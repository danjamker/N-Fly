 (Dykstra et al., 2004) This variable was recoded from seven to five categories, by merging the first two (not at all (n = 99) and once (n = 77)) and the last two categories (several times a week (n = 60) and daily (n = 29)), in order to avoid categories with too few cases (Table 1). Characteristics of sibling a (gender, educational attainment) were coded by use of the sibling identification code (see Dykstra et al., 2004). The variables selected for analyses are presented in Table 1. Educational attainment was recoded in order to avoid categories with very low frequencies. As with contact frequency, the first two (incomplete (n = 6) and primary (n = 76)) and last two categories (university (n = 193) and postgraduate (n = 20)) of the educational attainment variable were merged. Difference in educational attainment was calculated as the absolute difference between siblings in educational attainment categories. Additional information on variables can be found in the NKPS codebook (Dykstra et al., 2004). Missing values on variables were treated listwise for the multinomial logistic regression.

2.2. Statistical methods
We will use multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to investigate the independent effect of birth order on the dependent variable, contact frequency ([Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989], [Menard, 1995] and [Pampel, 2000]). Multinomial logistic regression as a statistical technique is relatively free of assumptions and statistically robust. MLR is very similar to ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in many aspects. For instance, ?, the standardized parameter estimate in MLR corresponds to the standardized estimates (?) from OLS. Also, Wald test statistics which correspond to each ? are similar to t-test statistics corresponding to ?'s in OLS. Unlike OLS, however, where parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of squares, parameters in MLR are estimated by maximum likelihood. Besides this MLR is quite similar to ordinary least squares regression and is adequate for analyzing independent effects on a dependent nominal variable. 
We will construct two models for contact frequencies. In the first analysis (n1 = 1558), we will investigate the independent effect of birth order while controlling for the effects of educational attainment, difference between the siblings in educational attainment, age, gender and gender of the random sibling. This first model does not control for the effect of geographical distance as more than ten percent of the respondents lack these data. A second analysis including a Euclidean distance measure allows one to estimate the effect for birth order while controlling for the other variables plus geographical distance between siblings (n2 = 1394; see Dykstra et al., 2004). 
As the parameter selection procedure for the variables in each analysis, we used forward stepwise. For both analyses, outcomes were the same in terms of model fit and Nagelkerke R2 (1991) when backward stepwise was used instead (data not shown). Nagelkerke R2 is a frequently used measure of variance explained in MLR, and is similar to R2 from OLS. We will report the likelihood ratio tests for variables in the model and parameter estimates with their respective significance levels (see Peng, Lee, &amp; Ingersoll, 2002). Likelihood ratio tests (pllr) are used to examine the significance of a variable for the MLR model, while the Wald statistic is used to determine the significance of parameter estimates (pwald). We will use a five percent significance level for all analyses. 
3. Results
3.1. Analysis 1
Fig. 1 shows the distribution of contact frequency for firstborns, middleborns and lastborns. A higher proportion of firstborns than laterborns have contact on at least a weekly basis but other than that the distributions for firstborns, middleborns and lastborns appear quite similar. This leads us to expect that significant differences between firstborns and laterborns will mainly exist for comparisons between "at least once a week' and other categories but not necessarily for comparisons between other categories. 
Fig. 1. Birth order and contact with a random sibling over the past 12 months (?2 = 16.16; p &lt; 0.05). Within each category, proportions add up to 1. 
We constructed a stepwise MLR with age, educational attainment, gender and birth order of the respondent, difference in educational attainment between siblings and gender of the sibling as predictors for frequency of contact with a sibling. Birth order, educational attainment and age of the respondent, and gender of the sibling proved significant predictors of frequency of contact with a sibling in this stepwise procedure. The difference in attained level of education between siblings, and the gender of the respondent, were not significant and were dropped from the model. The final model has a Nagelkerke R2 of 0.14 (Model Fit ?2 = 226.21; df = 44; p &lt; 0.0001; Table 2). It thus performs well according to usual standards in the social sciences. As predicted, birth order independently influenced frequency of face-to-face contact with a sibling over the past 12 months once other key variables had been controlled for. 
Table 2. 
Parameter estimates (?) and odds ratios (exp(?)) for daily/several times a week from multinomial logistic regression (analysis 1) with as reference category of contact frequency set as “not at all or once” 
The Wald statistic allows to determine the significance of individual parameters, the likelihood ratio test allows to determine the overall significance of a variable (pLLR). Reference categories for independent categorical variables have parameter estimates set to 0.
Parameters from Table 2 are most easily interpreted in terms of odds ratios (exp(?)). For instance, firstborns are 1.88 times more likely than lastborns to have had contact several times a week or daily, instead of once or not at all over the past 12 months. This effect is found while controlling for the other variables (educational attainment, age, gender of sibling) in the model. Odds ratios for interval variables, age for example, are interpreted as follows: an increase in age of one year makes it 0.92 times more likely that a respondent has had contact several times a week or daily, instead of once or not at all. 
By substituting categories we can obtain odds ratios that allow comparison between different categories of birth order and contact frequency. As was apparent from Fig. 1, significant differences between firstborns and laterborns are mainly limited to comparisons between "at least once a week' and a different category (Table 3). Odds ratios for comparisons of "at least once a week' with another category showed considerable differences between firstborns and laterborns in their frequency of contact, with odds ratios ranging from around 1.7 to 2.4. Depending on the contrast category, firstborns are thus between 1.7 and 2.4 times more likely than laterborns to have had contact on at least a weekly basis with their sibling. With the exception of two comparisons of "daily or several times a week' with another category, differences between firstborns and laterborns for other comparisons were not significant. For comparisons between "daily or several times a week' with another category, there are no consistent differences between firstborns and laterborns.

*p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001 (Wald statistic). For example: firstborns are 1.9 times more likely than middleborns to have contact at least once a week instead of once or not at all over the past 12 months. These effects are found while controlling for the other variables in analysis 1.
3.2. Analysis 2
We constructed a second stepwise MLR-model for contact frequency, with the same independent variables used for analysis 1 (gender, age, educational attainment and birth order of the respondent, gender of the sibling and difference between the siblings in educational attainment). In addition, we also included a measure for geographical distance between the siblings as an independent variable in this second analysis. In the stepwise procedure, geographical distance, age and birth order of the respondent, and gender of the sibling proved significant predictors of frequency of contact with a sibling. The MLR-model with these variables had a Nagelkerke R2 of 0.3 (Model Fit ?2 = 463.63; df = 20; p &lt; 0.0001; Table 4). This model thus performs very well according to common standards in the social sciences. In line with analysis 1, difference in educational attainment and gender of the respondent did not prove significant predictors of contact frequency in the stepwise procedure. Contrary to analysis 1, however, educational attainment was not a significant predictor of contact frequency. As in the first analysis we can conclude that birth order independently influences frequency of face-to-face contact with a random sibling. Firstborns are approximately two and half times more likely than lastborns to have had contact several times a week or daily, instead of once or not at all over the past 12 months (Table 4). 
Table 4. 
Parameter estimates (?) and odds ratios (exp(?)) for contact "daily/several times a week' compared to "not at all or once' (analysis 2) 
The Wald statistic allows determination of the significance of individual parameters, whilst the likelihood ratio test allows determination of the overall significance of a variable (pLLR). Reference categories for independent variables have parameter estimates set to 0.
As in the first analysis, we can obtain odds ratios by substituting categories, which are reported in Table 5. The significant differences between firstborns and laterborns are mainly limited to comparisons between "at least once a week' and other categories, as in analysis 1 (Table 3). Significant odds ratios for these comparisons showed similar sized effects (1.7–3) as those from analysis 1 (1.7–2.4). There were also some significant differences between firstborns and laterborns in comparisons between "daily or several times week' with other categories (Table 5). Yet, as in analysis 1, these significant differences between firstborns and laterborns when comparing "daily or several times a week' with other categories were not a consistent finding. 
Table 5. 
Odds ratios (exp(?)) for comparisons between different birth orders and contact frequencies 
*p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001 (Wald statistic). For example: firstborns are 1.96 times more likely than middleborns to have contact at least once a week instead of once or not at all over the past 12 months (p &lt; 0.05). These effects are found while controlling for the other variables in analysis 2.
4. Discussion
We find that firstborns have significantly more face-to-face contact with their sibling than laterborns. In general, firstborns are significantly more likely than laterborns to have had contact on a weekly basis over the past 12 months. Other comparisons between categories of contact frequencies showed no significant differences between firstborns and laterborns, with the exceptions of occasional comparisons between "daily or several times a week' with another category. The differences between firstborns and laterborns are thus largely restricted to comparisons between "at least once a week' and other categories. The finding that firstborns are more likely than laterborns to have contact with a sibling on a weekly basis appears robust, however. It cannot be attributed to other variables summarized in Table 1. The differences between firstborns and laterborns in contact with their sibling are considerable, with odds ratios ranging from 1.66 to 3. 
As for the mechanism underlying these results, firstborns only have younger siblings, whereas middleborns have a mixture of younger and older siblings, and lastborns only older siblings. A bias whereby individuals make a greater effort to spend time with younger than older siblings, would account for the difference between firstborn and laterborn behaviour observed here. Thus, the results, as well as being consistent with Sulloway's (1996) claim, accord with the more general predictions of kin selection theory (Hamilton, 1964). However, middleborns did not differ from lastborns in their behaviour, either by making more investment, as the theory of kin selection and reproductive value would predict Hughes, 1988, or by making less investment, as the finding that middleborns are the least close to family in general ([Salmon and Daly, 1998] and [Salmon, 2003]) might suggest.
