1   Recent scholarship on 1 Thessalonians
Like all Paul's letters, 1 Thessalonians has received much scholarly attention in recent decades. Since historical-critical interests drive much of this scholarly exertion, the question of origins remains the pervasive concern. Karl Donfried, a prominent Thessalonians scholar, articulates well the question motivating much contemporary scholarship on 1 Thessalonians: 'What was Thessalonica like when Paul first visited and established a Christian community there and what impact does this information have for understanding 1 and 2 Thessalonians?'1
   There have been a variety of answers to this question. To anchor ourselves somewhere within the sea of conference papers, arguments, counter-arguments and monographs provoked by 1 Thessalonians we shall focus on three seminal and prominent essays. When each of these essays appeared it moved the argument on significantly and inspired other scholars to adopt new lines of approach in understanding the original context of delivery and reception of 1 Thessalonians. As we shall see, the three essays – by Karl Donfried,2 John Barclay3 and Abraham Malherbe4 – have come to act as nodal points within 1 Thessalonians scholarship.
   Karl Donfried's signal essay of 1985, 'The Cults of Thessalonica and the Thessalonian Correspondence', did not of course arise from a scholarly vacuum. Donfried's argument, that attention to the religious and civic cults prominent in first-century Thessalonica assists in understanding the letter's ethical and eschatological admonitions, is substantiated only with the help of archaeological discoveries made earlier in the century.5 Straining hard to hear the 'definite connotations' for the first-century Thessalonians,6 Donfried attempts to place exhortations such as those in 1 Thess. 4:3–8 within the sexual excesses associated with the cult of Dionysus.7 For Donfried these ethical exhortations represent Paul's attempt to mark out the distinctive behaviour expected of the Thessalonian church, in marked contrast to their former way of life, still evident in the numerous cults of Thessalonica.8 So too, if we are equipped with an awareness of Thessalonica's religio-political climate, is it possible to understand the politically unsettling nature of Paul's visit, testified not least in Acts 17:6–7. The Thessalonian Christians' proclamation of another 'kingdom' (2:12) and 'Lord' (2:19) would have violated the Paphlagonian loyalty oath to Augustus and his successors.9 Political opposition to Paul's gospel thus provides the context for the Thessalonian Christians' frequently mentioned affliction and suffering,10 a persecution Donfried extends as far as possible martyrdom.11
   Donfried's call to pay attention to the religio-political climate of 1 Thessalonians has been enthusiastically endorsed by subsequent interpreters. Holland Lee Hendrix, consolidating the arguments of various scholars,12 reads the 'peace and security' slogan of 1 Thess. 5:3 as a direct riposte and critique of prominent Pax Romana propaganda.13 Relying upon epigraphic and numismatic evidence and recent archaeological discoveries, Hendrix argues that between the first century BCE and the first century CE there was a significant shift in the political affiliations of Thessalonica towards Rome.14 Paul's apocalyptic prediction of what would happen to those who trust the Roman assurance of pax et securitas is thus to be understood from this political context, for it is those who rely upon the might of the Roman Empire who will 'be the first to fall victim to the sudden wrath of God'.15
   These counter-Imperial readings of 1 Thessalonians have found themselves congenial company within broader political readings of Paul's proclamation that have come into vogue. Central to the argument that Paul is an irritant of the Imperial system is the insistence that the background of Paul's use of 'gospel' (??????????) is that the same word was associated with Imperial proclamations of victory and conquest. This is especially relevant for a letter in which the term 'gospel' has a proportionately high occurrence.16 Political readings of Paul have found expression in 1 Thessalonians scholarship most recently in J. R. Harrison's attempt to place the eschatological imagery of 1 Thess. 4:13–5:11 in an anti-Imperial, counter-cultural framework.17 Like the work of Donfried, which can be understood as its forefather, J. R. Harrison's article reconstructs the allusions and connotations as the letter's original audience would have heard them. Just as for Donfried, Harrison's driving concern is to understand the hostile response of the Romans, as evidenced in Acts 17:7.18 Harrison argues that Paul's chosen words and phrases throughout 1 Thessalonians, with their constant Imperial allusions, are 'a radical subversion of Roman eschatological imagery and terminology'.19 Sensitivity to the letter's Imperial context persuades us of Paul's intention: to demonstrate the superiority of the risen and returning Christ to worldly, yet dominant, Imperial eschatologies. Thus, the various other contexts that have been suggested for Paul's eschatological admonitions – Gnostics contradicting Paul by spiritualising belief in the resurrection or sheer ignorance on the part of the Thessalonians, to list just two – are displaced in favour of an image of Paul as a political subversive.
   John Barclay's essay 'Conflict in Thessalonica' shares something in common with these 'political' readings of 1 Thessalonians, insofar as his prime interest is 'the conflict in Thessalonica between Christians and non-Christians'.20 Barclay's careful analysis of the likely causes of conflict in Thessalonica steers away from Donfried's tentative suggestion that some Thessalonian Christians died for their faith.21 Rather, the suffering frequently mentioned in 1 Thessalonians is best understood as 'social harassment',22 emanating from fellow Gentiles angered by those who had abruptly shunned their regular civic and religious activities as a consequence of their conversion to Christianity.23
   John Barclay's essay is important, not just because it provides a refinement of the excesses evident in Donfried's and Robert Jewett's work on 1 Thessalonians, but also in the overtures it makes to social-scientific study of the letter. After discussing the likely causes of the social conflict in first-century Thessalonica, Barclay examines the letter's dualist apocalyptic symbolism, and argues that if we are aware of the Thessalonians' sense of social dislocation, then it is clear that experience and symbol will become mutually reinforcing.24 The apocalyptic contours of 1 Thessalonians are thus best understood if we are sensitive to the social implications of the Thessalonians' traumatic conversion.25 In the conclusion, however, Barclay states explicitly what has been implicit throughout, his tentative interest in applying sociological models to the Thessalonians' conversion experience. Citing the influence of Louis Coser's The Functions of Social Conflict, Barclay states that 'opposition from outsiders can serve a beneficial function in defining the boundaries of a group and reinforcing its boundaries'.26
   Barclay's overtures to applying social-scientific approaches to study of 1 Thessalonians have been eagerly taken up by Todd Still and Craig S. De Vos. The work of these two scholars, in which sociological models of conflict are applied to the study of 1 Thessalonians, demonstrates the clear influence of John Barclay.27
   Todd Still's Conflict at Thessalonica: A Pauline Church and its Neighbours is explicitly concerned with recovering the nature of the suffering experienced by Paul's converts in Thessalonica, an instance of inter-group conflict which he proposes can be understood best through the lenses of social-scientific study of deviance and conflict.28 The influence of John Barclay's work on the social situation in Thessalonica is evident throughout Still's monograph, with 'Conflict in Thessalonica' being cited some thirty-five times. For Still, the apocalyptic tone of 1 Thessalonians is Paul's polemical response to the social dislocation both he and his converts were experiencing;29 the Thessalonian Christians would have attracted the opprobrium of non-Christian family, friends and acquaintances for identifying with an 'upstart movement';30 and like Barclay he argues that the suffering of the Thessalonians emanated exclusively from fellow Gentiles, and not a group of townspeople that might have included Jews.31 Likewise, in broad sympathy with Barclay's thesis, Still locates the source of this Gentile opposition in their suspicion that conversion to Christianity was 'subversive to the foundational institutions of Greco-Roman society, namely, family, religion and government'.32 Todd Still's more obviously independent contribution lies in his awareness of social-scientific study of intergroup conflict, and his application of this to the situation of external opposition portrayed in 1 Thessalonians. The conflict endured by the Thessalonian Christians, Still argues, had three effects: it reinforced the faith of the afflicted Christians; it strengthened congregational relations; and it served to heighten their eschatological hope in Christ's return.33
   Craig S. De Vos' Church and Community Conflicts: The Relationships of the Thessalonian, Corinthian, and Philippian Churches with their Wider Civic Communities demonstrates an equal indebtedness to Barclay's 1993 essay (as well as some of Barclay's earlier work). De Vos' aim is to draw on social-scientific theory to explain why some of Paul's churches experienced conflict with outsiders, whilst others did not.34 Where Still gives a fairly broad overview of social-scientific study of intergroup conflict,35 De Vos examines social-scientific theories of the development of conflict in Mediterranean societies, investigating why conflict might vary in intensity in different contexts. De Vos argues that Greco-Roman cities, with their high degree of socialisation, can be classified as Gemeinschaft-types of community,36 those whose close internal bonds make them more predisposed to sharp conflict.37 The differences between Greek and Roman societies in conflict response can be traced to divergent approaches and attitudes towards religion.38 Consolidating his argument with a comparison between the social-structural composition of Greek and Roman cities,39 De Vos proposes that Greek communities represent a higher-conflict culture than Roman communities (although both, being Mediterranean, represent a high-conflict culture). De Vos successively reconstructs the nature of first-century Thessalonica and the Christian community established by Paul before examining the 'severe conflict' between the church and its civic neighbours.40 This high level of conflict can be linked to Thessalonica's status as a civitas libera and a correspondingly dominant Greek mentality in terms of political structure and religious practice. Such conflict can be traced to a combination of Thessalonica's norms, values and beliefs; the lack of cross-cutting ties or ethnic integration within the Thessalonian church; and the Thessalonian Christians' impotence within the wider political structures of the city.41
   Abraham Malherbe's essay ' “Gentle as a Nurse”: The Cynic Background to 1 Thess ii' decisively interrupted hitherto dominant interpretation of 1 Thess. 2:1–12. For many decades these verses had overwhelmingly been read as apologetic, though there was little agreement about whether Paul was defending himself from specific attacks by either Jewish or Gnostic opponents.42 There had been some occasional lone voices, not least that of Martin Dibelius in 1937, who proposed that Paul was drawing on examples of wandering Cynic philosophers who held up their selfless behaviour as a paradigm.43
   Malherbe's fuller exposition of this thesis in his 1970 essay has now come to represent an influential riposte to apologetic readings of 1 Thess. 2:1–12 and thus to reading the text always as a foil to an event lying behind it. Malherbe exposes the similarities in language and style between Paul and the Cynic philosopher Dio Chrysostom's (40–120 CE) Alexandrian oration in which he sets out the qualities of a true philosopher. Crucial for the thesis Malherbe is trying to draw out of this parallel is that in Dio's oration there is 'no question of his [Dio] having to defend himself here against specific charges that he was a charlatan'.44 Rather, Dio's aim is to illustrate the kind of preacher he is, by comparing himself to other Cynic philosophers, many of whom he denigrates. Malherbe demonstrates how 'strikingly similar' are Dio's critical depiction of Cynic preachers and Paul's antithetical description of his own behaviour in Thessalonica.45 Many of these similarities demonstrate compelling lexical parallels.46 If these parallels convince us, it is not unreasonable to use Dio's context in helping us understand 1 Thessalonians 2:
