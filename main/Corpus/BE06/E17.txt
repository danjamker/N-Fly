* Triathlon's triple challenges
* It all started for Olly at the age of eight, when will it start for you? 
A thirst for adrenaline and demand for excellence drive double-European-champion Olly Freeman through triathlon's triple challenges. Olly, an elite Mazda Ambassador is also driven by the new Mazda CX-7. 

If you're ready for a raw challenge and a triple dose of pure exhilaration, three is the magic number. Triathlon's unique combination of disciplines - swim, bike and run - are a true test of body and spirit for the discerning thrill-seeker. And as the sport's rising star, Olly Freeman explains, it all starts in the water. "The swim is the first leg, so it's the one on your mind as you drive to the race," says Freeman. But, as Olly remarks, it can be a real baptism of fire.

"At world cup events - triathlon's equivalent of the Grand Prix - you have 80 guys in the water, it's crazy." So you get the intense buzz of competition as soon as you dip your toe in, but as if to encapsulate the essence of the sport from the off, you need to strike a balance between all out fury and clever thinking. "There's quite an adrenaline rush in the crowd, but you need to conserve your supplies for the rest of the race," says Freeman. "As with motor sport, getting a good start is critical. Get half a stroke ahead and hit the first turn out in front and you'll be swimming in clear water as I was at the European-Championships this year." 

So a good start is the key. It all started for Olly at the age of eight when he won his first race on a battered old mountain bike. When will it start for you? Your first step can be the first of our exclusive training guides (see Body Engineering Part 1). Then check out next month's Men's Health for Part 2, when it's time to get on your bike.

"My sport gives me the mentality of constantly striving for excellence and that transfers to everything in my life," says Freeman. "It's specially true when choosing a car, because with all the travelling to and from training and race locations, driving is like a fourth discipline. With an exciting drive and plenty of room in the back for my triathlon kit, the Mazda CX-7 has everything I need from a car."

* Get on your bike
* Stage two of our introduction to the thrills and spills of triathlon 
The second helping in triathlon's triple adrenaline hit is served in double measures. Stage two is all about two wheels as you climb out of the water and into the bike saddle. And as Britain's Olympic contender Olly Freeman explains, you have to be ready for anything. "There's a huge buzz on the bike," says Freeman. "Jostling for position shoulder to shoulder, flying round corners and hitting 60kmph...then there are guys touching wheels and hitting the deck right in front of you! Also, the bike leg is the most affected by the course, sometimes it's flat and fast, sometimes hilly and technical." And the demands aren't just on your body; in the heat of the contest you need clear thinking. "It's a tough tactical call - a fine balance between getting near the front and conserving energy for the run."

The second secret of two-wheeled success is moving smoothly from stroke power to pedal power. "The transition is incredibly important as it's where splits occur in the field and missing a bike pack by a second can mean starting the run with a 3-minute handicap," says Freeman. "And it's the more complex of the race's two transitions. You need to get your wetsuit off while running, get your helmet on and jump on the bike at speed." So, even the transition is a high-octane experience.

"The bike leg makes you so finely tuned to appreciate responsiveness, stability and comfort as you push yourself to the limits. It means I demand the same from my car after the race, and the Mazda CX-7 delivers the adrenaline of racing without the aching quads. It even fits my bike in the back!" 

Your transition from the armchair to the adrenaline of triathlon starts with the second of our exclusive training guides (see Body Engineering Part 2). Then check out next month's Men's Health for your third and final instalment, when it's time to really get in the running.

Weeks 1-4 
You should aim for two sessions a week. 

Session 1: 
Endurance. Your goal is increasing the time you can swim for continuously. Calculate your target time for the race distance (eg 45 minutes for olympic distance) then work towards swimming for that long without resting. Don't worry about how far you actually cover, just keep going for that time. 

Session 2: 
Pace. Break your target distance into chunks - if you're aiming for olympic distance, that could be 30x50m or 15x100m - then swim at your goal pace, resting between chunks (for say, 30 secs). If you're 
on pace, start cutting your rests. 

Week 5 
You should be comfortably continuously swimming for your goal time, so switch to two pace-improving interval sessions. 

Week 6 
One interval session, covering around 60% of your week 5 sessions. Swimming is low impact so you can train closer to the race than with running, but you should leave a clear two days before race day.

Bonus tips: 

Train in open water to get used to the choppy surface and lack of reference points.

Work on looking up every 10 strokes without breaking rhythm. This'll help you sight buoys in the race and save wasted time veering off-course. 

A well-fitted wetsuit is worth its weight in gold – it'll add buoyancy without restricting movement and improve your time. Too baggy and it'll ship on water, slowing you down.

Weeks 1-4 
Aim for two sessions a week.  

Session 1:
Endurance. You're aiming to build up how long you can bike for non-stop here. Calculate your target time for the race distance (eg 75 minutes for Olympic), then work towards cycling for twice that time without resting. Don't worry too much about how much distance you actually cover, just keep turning the pedals. 

Session 2:
Pace. In the first week, take half your race target time, break it up into 5-minute chunks and ride at race pace for those chunks, resting 2 minutes between them. In week 2, do the same but increase to 60% of target time. In week 3, make it 70%, and so on...  

Week 5 
You should be continuously cycling for twice your goal time in your endurance session now. Make the second session a 10-mile effort at your best speed. 

Week 6 
One session, lasting roughly your goal time at endurance pace with five bursts of 1 minute at race speed, resting 3 minutes in between. Take a minimum 2 days off before the race.


Bonus tips: 

Get used to using cages on your pedals or cycling shoes and clip less pedals. This'll give you the edge in energy transfer to the bike. 

Invest the cash and the effort in using tri bars instead of standard handlebars. Do it right and you'll greatly increase your overall speed. 

Make sure your tyres are well inflated and your chain is clean. Keeping the chain and chain set in good working order makes cycling faster and easier.

Learn to use your gears properly. Intelligent use of gears makes all the difference in terms shaving your time and keeping your legs fresh for the run to follow.

* Give yourself the edge
* Mazda Ambassador Olly Freeman's three top swim tips 
To give you the edge, here are Olly's three top tips:

1  "You need to create a balance between a swimmer's, a cyclist's and a runner's physique. Focus most of your training on endurance - repeated lengths, not time in the weights room - to build your base layer of fitness. 

2  "Technique-wise, work on that all-important start. Fine-tune your diving technique to get yourself ahead of the pack when you hit the water. 

3  "Make sure you do some of your training in open water. It's crucial to get used to choppier waters, and the extra buoyancy and restricted movement that come with wearing a wetsuit. 

* Stay ahead of the pack
* Mazda Ambassador Olly Freeman's three top bike tips 
Insider tips to keep you on top, direct from Olly's locker:

1  "Don't get too hung up on the specs and weight of your bike. A comfortable ride and good position will get you much further up the road than a few grams saved on the seat-post. 

2  "Learn to fuel well. Electrolyte drinks and energy gels that don't upset your stomach are priceless. 

3  "Heed the old saying: ‘Winter miles, summer smiles' Build cycling fitness with a shed load of miles over the winter. It isn't easy when it's cold and tipping down, but it counts come race time. 

* Eat to get ripped
* Follow this plan to get ripped and build muscle 
* Get ripped 
* As you reduce the amount of calories you eat your body starts to burn fat for energy. But calorie cutting can make you lose muscle – so don't overdo it. The trick: cut calories from carbs and eat more protein. This safeguards your muscle. If you cut too many calories your body thinks it's starving so it starts to conserve and store them, which reduces the rate at which you burn body fat. This plan bypasses this survival mechanism because you'll be alternating between the two workouts and meal plans. During this phase, eat your carbs early in the morning and right before you train to give you energy to exercise. On your rest days, eat according to the "Build muscle" meal plan to give you enough calories to recover properly. 

This plan has to be followed in conjunction with the "Build muscle/Get ripped" workout. Click here for the workout plan.

* Get muscle
* To add muscle you need extra calories floating around your bloodstream, but just make sure you don't get too many from carbs. Eat the carbs before and after you train to give you the energy to exercise and replace the energy you'll have lost during training. Bracket your workouts with a protein shake to get easily absorbed protein at the time when your muscles need it most. On your rest days revert back to the "Get ripped" meal plan to ensure you're not porking up, but still getting enough nutrients to grow only lean muscle.
