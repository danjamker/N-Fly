First, that the patterns have been a result of underlying differences in innate
cognitive ability between males and females (Rudd, 1984; Goodhart, 1988, 1995;
McCrum, 1994; Lynn, 1996; Holdstock, 1998). Secondly, that they reflect differences
in respect of broad gender-differentiated dispositions. Whether it is assumed that such
variations are bestowed by dint of nature or nurture, it has been argued that a greater
willingness on the part of male students to take risks in relation to their assessments,
as well as their experiencing lower levels of anxiety about assessment contexts, has
predisposed them to achieve more Firsts (Goodhart, 1988; Spurling, 1990; Sutherland,
1996, 1997; Martin, 1997; Spear, 1997; Leman, 1999; Mann, 2001; Pirie, 2001;
Smithers, 2003). Conversely, it has been suggested that female students' greater levels
of cautiousness or conscientiousness (Harris, 1940; Rudd, 1984; Clarke, 1988;
Goodhart, 1988; Spurling, 1990; McCrum, 1996; Sutherland, 1996, 1997; Martin,
1997; Leman, 1999; Mann, 2001; Pirie, 2001; Woodfield et al., 2005; Woodfield et al.,
2006) has predisposed them to get more "good' degrees overall.
Third, and finally, although they often assume broad gender differences in ability
or disposition as part of their argument, some researchers have placed primary analytical
emphasis on the academic subject in undergraduate studies when attempting to
understand the gender gap. In particular, it has been argued that male students
achieve more First Class degrees than female students largely because of what has
been called a "compositional effect' (McNabb et al., 2002), whereby they achieve
more Firsts because they are quantitatively dominant in subjects that award more top
degrees (Clarke, 1988; Thomas, 1990; Chapman, 1996; Leman, 1999; McCrum,
1994; McNabb et al., 2002; Richardson &amp; Woodley, 2003; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2001;
Surtees et al., 2002).
First Class achievement, discipline variation and gender
A First Class degree in one subject is generally assumed to carry similar weight to a
First Class degree elsewhere (Hoskins et al., 1997, p. 321). The award of the top
degree classification is taken to mark out its recipients as having excelled regardless
of their discipline. Yet there are very significant variations across areas in terms of the
proportion of Firsts they award, with the Sciences, and especially the Physical
Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering, awarding the greatest proportion of top
degrees (Nevin, 1972; Bee &amp; Dolton, 1985; Clarke, 1988; Johnes &amp; Taylor, 1990;
McCrum, 1994; Hoskins et al., 1997; Leman, 1999, 2004; Mellanby et al., 2000;
Richardson, 2000; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2001; Surtees et al., 2002; Richardson &amp;
Woodley, 2003), to the extent that research conducted at Cambridge concludes that
science students are over one and a half times more likely to be awarded a First than
fellow Arts students (Surtees et al., 2002; see also Mellanby et al., 2000).
It is suggested this pattern is attributable to the material of science disciplines being
more easily subjected to assessments involving marking regimes based on a "right/
wrong' dichotomy. This creates greater latitude for students to more frequently gain
much higher (as well as much lower) grades. By contrast, the subject matter of the
Arts are taken to be more dependent upon the abilities of students to select key pieces
of evidence from texts and marshal them in a persuasive manner (Read &amp; Francis,
2001). As a consequence, marks arrays within the Arts are more likely to be bunched
between the traditional classification mark parameters of the 30th and 70th percentile
thresholds (Nevin, 1972; Bligh et al., 1980; Johnes, 1992; McNabb et al., 2002).
Manifest differences in the proportions of men and women entering different
degree disciplines persist (Weinreich-Haste, 1981; McCrum, 1994; HESA, 2003a;
Holdstock, 1998; McNabb et al., 2002). Men elect to undertake a degree within the
Sciences far more often than women, and they are specifically over-represented
within the Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering where most Firsts are
awarded. Women tend to elect to take degrees in the Arts, Humanities and Social
Sciences, where fewer Firsts are awarded (Bligh et al., 1980; McCrum, 1994;
Richardson, 2000; McNabb et al., 2002; Richardson &amp; Woodley, 2003). Whether
this pattern is taken to be a function of serendipity, different socialisation trajectories,
different types of innate abilities or a combination of factors, it has led to claims
that the gender gap between men and women with respect to Firsts may be largely,
if not wholly, explicable in terms of what McNabb et al. (2002) has called a "compositional
effect' (Bligh, 1980; Clarke, 1988; Goodhart, 1988; McCrum, 1994; Chapman,
1996; Richardson, 2000; McNabb et al., 2002; Richardson &amp; Woodley,
2003).
Clarke argued as early as 1988 that the male tendency to achieve the top degree
class was being significantly overestimated, as well as misunderstood, because of
researchers' propensity to ignore the effects of the quantitative domination of men in
Science in general, and the Physical Sciences in particular, although he also noted
that women failed to get significantly more Firsts than men in any subject category at
the time. More recently, Richardson has concluded that:
Indeed, we DO know one very good reason why women are less likely to get first and third
class degrees than men. It is well established that proportionately more such degrees are
awarded in the physical sciences and engineering than in the arts, social sciences and
humanities … one would expect an apparent gender difference in the distribution of
degree classes simply because men are more likely to choose the former subjects and
women more likely to choose the latter. (2000, p. 286)
By contrast, other researchers, while recognising the importance of subject variation
in their analyses, conclude that the compositional effect no more than partially
explains the gender gap. As McNabb et al. themselves concluded, that "differences in
such things as subject mix … cannot explain the gender gap in achievement to any
significant degree' (2002, p. 499; see also Goodhart, 1988; Leman, 1999, 2004).
The current paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the extent to which
"compositional' effects from the Sciences in general, and from a Science subset of
Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering in particular, can explain the
predominance of male students within the First Class bracket. It will do so via analysis
of the largest data-set yet to be used to test the hypothesis: complete HESA statistics
detailing degree outcomes for all UK-domiciled students between 1994/95 and 2001/
02. As well as allowing us to offer a more comprehensive and definitive test of the
hypothesis, this analysis permits observation of what, if any, variations exist in relation
to the gender gap, and its relationship to broad subject differences, over the period
concerned. Notwithstanding the importance of pointing to inter-institutional
variations in the First Class performance of men and women, it is also hoped that
focusing upon a national data-set of this size will clarify the picture with regard to
overall trends.
Method
Participants
The HESA data-set that formed the basis of the results presented here comprised
1,707,4083 UK-domiciled students completing an honours degree in UK Higher
Education institutions between the years 1994/95 and 2001/02. It included information
on the degree class achieved, discipline of degree and sex per student.
Students who were unclassified for whatever reason (n = 156,981) were removed
from the data-set prior to analysis as HESA does not distinguish between those who
failed to receive a classification within an honours degree programme and those who
took degrees where no honours classification was available (HESA, 2004).
Furthermore, also prior to analysis, students who could not be characterised either
as Science or Arts (including Social Sciences) graduates were excluded. This
included students taking mixed combinations of Arts and Science subjects, those with
invalid entries for degree subjects (taken together, n = 254,197) and architecture
students (n = 45,284) as a decision could not be reached on whether the latter represented
Science or Arts students.4
Analytical strategy
The analyses were conducted using SPSS and comprised calculating frequencies and
running chi-square tests for independence to determine the relationship between
gender and First Class attainment, as the data are measured on a categorical/nominal
level (see Chapman, 1996; Spear, 1997; Farsides &amp; Woodfield, forthcoming).
The data-set was analysed to determine whether male and female students differed
in terms of their representation and performance regarding Firsts within the selected
subject areas of Sciences versus Arts, and a "Core Science' subset of the Physical
Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering5—often given the most credit for determining
the size of the gender gap—and non-Core Science (defined as all degrees other
than Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering).
Due to the very large size of the data-set, statistically significant results are likely to
be produced in such analyses despite very weak associations between the variables. In
order to gain a reliable sense of the strength of the association between variables, an
appropriate measure of the effect size (Cramer's V)6 was deployed. Cramer's V
ranges in value from 0 to 1, with values of approximately 0.10, 0.30 and 0.50
representing small, medium and large effect sizes, respectively (Green et al., 1997).7
Results
Table 1 outlines the proportions of degrees taken within each of the broad subject
areas of the Sciences versus the Arts, and Core Science versus non-Core Science
degrees, as well as the proportions of Firsts that are awarded within each of these
subject areas.
As can be seen, the proportion of students taking Science (around 41%) as opposed
to Arts degrees has remained remarkably stable over the eight-year period, although
the proportion taking Core Science has declined from 22.5% in 1994/95 to 17.2% in
2001/02. In terms of Firsts, of note is the overall steady increase in the proportions of
top degrees awarded, as well as the fact that a larger proportion is achieved in the
Sciences in general, and Core Science in particular, which awarded the top degree to
16.4% of its students in 2001/02. Chi-square analyses on the combined data-set
reveal that the difference between the proportions of Science Firsts (11.1%) versus
Arts Firsts (6.7%, ?2(1, 1,707,406) = 10,422.714, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.078)
is significantly different, although the strength of association is very small. Similarly,
a significantly greater proportion of Firsts were awarded in Core Science (13%) as
against other degrees (7.4%, ?2(1, 1,707,406) = 10,632.283, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V
= 0.079), although, again, the strength of association was small.
Chi-square analyses were then conducted to assess whether male and female
students differed in terms of their representation within the selected subject areas
(Table 2).
As can be seen, over the whole period, the Sciences in general had significantly
more male (57.7%) than female students (42.3%, ?2(1, 1,707,406) = 55,191.489, p
&lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.18), although again the strength of the association was relatively
small. Core Science also had significantly more males (74.7%) than females
(9.4%, ?2(1, 1,707,406) = 129,783.18, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.276), and the
strength of the association was approaching medium. Analysis of the data-set revealed
that this finding obtained for all the individual years between 1994 and 2002,
although the strength of the association between maleness and Science weakened
steadily over the period, as it did between maleness and Core Science, albeit to a
lesser extent.
A chi-square analysis was conducted on the combined data-set to assess whether
male and female students differed in terms of general degree outcome (Table 3).
Most notable in terms of gender and classification over the period is that a higher
proportion of males (9.3%) than females (7.9%) were awarded Firsts. They were also
awarded a higher proportion of Thirds/Pass degrees (12.1%) than females (6.7%).
Female undergraduates obtained a higher proportion of Upper Seconds (49.8%)
than males (40.5%). These findings were statistically significant (?2(3, 1,707,404)
22,838.638, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.116), and the strength of the association was
small to medium. Year on year analysis of the data-set revealed that this pattern
remained substantially stable.
As this analysis assesses the association between gender and all classifications,
however, a further chi-square analysis was conducted to assess the relationship
between gender and the achievement of First class degrees only.
