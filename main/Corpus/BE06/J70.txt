Parenting is seen as a 'hard' or 'challenging' job, requiring assistance from various sources (Grenier 2003). The perceived role of the UK Government is 'ensuring that all parents have access to the choice and support they need, improving services and strengthening the ways in which the wider family and communities support and nurture family life' (Home Office 1998, p. 3).
The UK Government has argued that 'good parenting and strong family relationships are key factors in providing children with the best start in life' (Her Majesty's Treasury &amp; Department of Work and Pensions 2001, p. viii), but 'good' parenting and child well-being are often undermined by the stresses associated with poverty (Hoghughi 1998). For example, children growing up in low-income homes are more likely than others to experience poor health throughout their lives (Gregg et al. 1999, Bradshaw 2002, Graham &amp; Power 2004). Despite measures by the UK Government to reduce child poverty, the scale of the problem remains substantial. In 2002–2003, for example, almost three in 10 children lived in low-income households (using a threshold of 60% of median income after housing costs), while those living with lone parents were particularly likely to be poor (Department of Work and Pensions 2004).
One way in which governments can intervene in the lives of poor families is to bolster the level of support available to them through statutory services, voluntary agencies and targeted Government programmes, such as Sure Start (Glass 1999). These measures are underpinned by evidence that social support, both informal and formal, is an important resource for poor parents (Thompson 1995, Williams &amp; Popay 1999, Kirk 2003). Support can include material or instrumental help, such as providing money, transport or child care, and emotional aspects (Hogan et al. 2002). Strong networks of relationships can help parents and children to cope with stress and develop resilience to poor circumstances (Fonagy et al. 1994), thus enhancing parents' ability to care for their children and maximise their welfare (Culbertson &amp; Schellenbach 1992). Research has suggested that informal support, including family and friendship networks (Hogan et al. 2002), is particularly effective in buffering the effects of disadvantage for families (Cochran et al. 1990), but the subjective experience of support, and the material and social context in which it is experienced, is likely to affect its value as a resource (Lakey &amp; Lutz 1996). The present paper draws upon a systematic review of qualitative research to explore low-income parents' experiences of informal and formal support networks, considering their strengths and weaknesses in the context of poverty. 
Materials and methods
 
Systematic review methods were used to locate, critically appraise and synthesise qualitative studies undertaken in the UK since 1987, which took as their focus subjective experiences of parenting in poverty. Reviews of primary research can be used to produce a map of the 'bigger picture', to facilitate understanding of a topic, identify common threads across studies and to facilitate theory development (Suri 1999, Kearney 2001, Hammersley 2002). The advantage of carrying out a systematic review, in comparison to a traditional literature review, is that the process is more transparent, less subject to researcher bias, and confines itself to evidence that has been quality appraised (Petticrew 2001, Hawker et al. 2002).
The systematic review protocol broadly followed the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2001) guidelines. In Stage 1 of the review, literature was located through a combination of electronic database searching, contacts with experts, and website and citation searching. At Stage 2, studies identified by the searches were sifted for relevance to the topic area and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the review. A double check was carried out on 500 references (7% of the total) with a high level of agreement between reviewers. Primary papers were then obtained for those papers which appeared, from an initial scanning of titles and abstracts, to be relevant to the present review. These were then further checked against the inclusion criteria (Stage 3).
At Stage 4, studies were quality appraised using a checklist that drew on earlier models of assessing qualitative research (Popay et al. 1998, Seale 1999, Mays &amp; Pope 2000, National Health Service Critical Appraisal Skills Programme 2001, Spencer et al. 2003). The checklist was divided into 10 main sections: research background; aims and objectives; study context; appropriateness of design; sampling; data collection; data analysis; reflexivity; contribution to knowledge; and research ethics. Specific questions were asked of the studies in each section. Two experienced researchers graded papers on a scale from A to D, initially independently, and then meeting for a discussion. Studies graded A–C were included in the main review (15 studies comprising 23 papers); those graded D were excluded (seven studies). The present paper is based on a subsample of studies (n = 12) which addressed this particular topic (see Table 1 below).
Meta-ethnographic methods were used to produce a qualitative meta-synthesis of findings (cf. Britten et al. 2002, Arai et al. 2003, Campbell et al. 2003, Harden et al. 2003). Meta-synthesis has been described as 'the bringing together and breaking down of findings, examining them, discovering the essential features, and, in some way, combining phenomenon into a transformed whole' (Schreiber et al. 1997, p. 314, cited in Finfgeld 2003). The analytic process followed Noblit &amp; Hare's (1988) guidelines for conducting a 'line of argument' meta-ethnographic synthesis. 
Results
 
Exploring the similarities in parents' accounts across studies identified certain advantages and drawbacks inherent in both informal and formal support systems as resources for poor parents, which the present paper goes on to describe. The review also highlighted differences in lone mothers' experiences of naturally occurring support and readiness to approach formal services for help.
Informal support: family and friends
In the main, informal support is female-centred; it is women who both provide and receive support. Across studies, mothers and female friends were pivotal to social support networks (Graham 1987, McKee 1987, Phoenix 1991, Cohen et al. 1992, Bostock 1998, Dearlove 1999, Ghate &amp; Hazel 2002). For example, family members often supplied material help to parents in cash or kind (e.g. meals or children's clothes), and helped with child care (Cohen et al. 1992, Kempson et al. 1994, Owens 1997, Bostock 1998, Gill et al. 2000, Dean 2001, Dean &amp; Shah 2002). Moreover, kin provided emotional support in the form of 'company and conversation' (Graham 1985, p. 163). Friends were also frequently called upon to help with personal, emotional distress, i.e. in 'getting through the moment' (Bostock 1998, p. 174, Gill et al. 2000). Typically, they provided:
Emotional support for myself, social support, I guess. My friends try to financially support me, but it is hard for them. They are just there for me – basically, if I need to give someone a good earbashing, I'll call on them. (Black lone mother, on income support, caring for one child aged 5 months) (Bostock 1998, p. 175)
The perception of being supported, which was strongly related to parents' sense of coping with the demands of parenting in poor circumstances, was connected with both the physical proximity and emotional connectedness of their supporters (Ghate &amp; Hazel 2002). However, in 'real life' parenting, the actual support received varied in quantity and quality (Graham 1987, Dearlove 1999, Ghate &amp; Hazel 2002). Importantly, Ghate &amp; Hazel (2002) found that levels of enacted support were generally low for the majority of parents in poor environments. For some parents, material factors, such as lack of transport, reduced their ability to access social support. For example, low-income women in Bostock's (1998) study led 'localised' lives; thus, their ability to visit family members and friends was restricted by time and expense. Similarly, Graham (1985) found that only a minority of female respondents living in a new town were in regular touch with relatives. [In contrast, the majority of parents in a 'high risk' neighbourhood lived in close proximity to their families and had frequent contact (Gill et al. 2000).] Family poverty was a limiting factor on enacted support for parents in several studies (Phoenix 1991, Bostock 1998, Dearlove 1999, McKendrick et al. 2003). For example, a number of respondents in McKendrick et al.'s (2003) study of low-income families in Scotland said that their entire family was 'on the bru' (in receipt of welfare benefits) (p. 48).
Material resources were not the only constraints on informal support which parents experienced. 'Negative support', a concept introduced by Ghate &amp; Hazel (2002), stresses the costs as well as benefits of informal support for parents in poor circumstances. Ghate &amp; Hazel (2002) argued that there is a fine dividing line between support and interference in family life, and highlighted the loss of valued privacy that receiving support from family members and friends can entail. Paradoxically, the above authors found that negative support most affected those parents with the highest level of problems, i.e. those who could potentially have the most to gain from informal help. Across studies, receiving informal support was often perceived as carrying moral obligations to reciprocate, with the expectation that support should be an exchange of time, money or advice (McKee 1987, Kempson et al. 1994, Bostock 1998, Dearlove 1999, Gill et al. 2000, Ghate &amp; Hazel 2002, McKendrick et al. 2003). For example:
Yes, like they help me so I help them. Like, you know, my cousin who normally looks after my kids when I am going out, she has got two of her own as well, but like, she leaves them down here as well to play in the garden and everything. I look after them as well as my own and sometimes that can be tiring. (Cohabiting Pakistani mother, on Family Credit, caring for two children aged 2 years and 12 months) (Bostock 1998, p. 178)
Research with medical populations has indicated that the beneficial aspects of support are linked with reciprocity. If recipients are unable to reciprocate in kind, their self-esteem may be threatened (Revenson 1990, Hogan et al. 2002). In Ghate &amp; Hazel's (2002) study, those parents who worried the most about reciprocity were those least likely to feel that they were coping well with parenting. Participants in McKendrick et al.'s (2003) study described how relying on material support from family members left them feeling 'bad', 'obligated' or 'owned'. This finding was confirmed by other studies, suggesting that reliance on help from kin for low-income families can lead to strained relationships between generations (McKee 1987, Cohen et al. 1992, Kempson et al. 1994). Cohen et al. (1992) also found that, for Asian parents in particular, dependence on others, especially of a financial nature, was associated with loss of status and self-esteem.
The present review suggests that the support networks of lone mothers are significantly different from women in two-parent families (Kempson et al. 1994, Bostock 1998, Dearlove 1999, Gill et al. 2000, Ghate &amp; Hazel 2002). For example, Ghate &amp; Hazel (2002) found that lone parents drew upon smaller social support networks than parents with partners. Although levels of enacted support were not significantly different amongst the two groups, more lone parents felt unsupported in caring for their children. According to the above authors, it is the perception of feeling supported that is a critical factor in coping with parenting in poor circumstances.
Importantly, Dearlove (1999) identified qualitative differences between 'alone' and 'not alone' lone mothers. 'Alone' mothers had few naturally occurring sources of support in their social networks, compared to those 'not alone' mothers who were able to share parenting responsibilities with partners or kin. Therefore, 'alone' mothers were more dependent on mutual support, often relying on other lone mothers with similar difficulties. Dearlove (1999) explained that 'in a setting of material hardship, women are looking to women who are themselves restricted by their own lack of resources as sources of support' (p. 265). Therefore, social networks for 'alone' mothers can be seen as founded on necessity rather than choice.
