DID YOU KNOW ...

- A workman who left the soap-mixing machine on too long was responsible for making Ivory Soap? Embarrassed by his mistake, the man threw the mess in a stream. Result: Ivory soap, the soap that floats.

- The Band-Aid bandage was invented by a Johnson &amp; Johnson employee whose wife had cut herself? Earl Dickson set out to develop a bandage that his wife could apply without any help. He placed a small piece of gauze in the center of a small piece of surgical tape. Today it is known as the Band-Aid bandage.

- The inventor of the World Wide Web, British-born Tim Berners-Lee, never made money on his invention, which revolutionized the computer world? In 1989 he envisioned a way to link documents on the Internet using ''hypertext'' so ''surfers'' could jump from one document to another through highlighted words. Berners-Lee decided not to patent his technology because he feared that use of the Web would become too expensive.

- Robert Adler has the dubious distinction of being the Father of the Couch Potato? Back in 1955 Adler was employed by what was then Zenith Radio Corp. He was asked to invent something that would allow viewers to turn down the TV volume without leaving their sitting area. After a series of flops, including a wired contraption that people tripped over, Adler's idea finally came by the use of sound waves -- the birth of the remote control.

- Parker Brothers executives turned down the game of Monopoly because it took too long to play and had ''52 fundamental errors.'' The game ended up in the hands of the company president who stayed up all night playing it. He was so impressed by the game that the next day he wrote to inventor Charles Darrow and bought it.

- It was melting ice cream that inspired the invention of the outboard motor? It was a warm summer day when Ole Evinrude rowed his boat to his favorite picnic spot when the ice cream he had with him started to melt. It was at this moment he had wished for a faster way to travel. This event lead to the idea of the outboard motor.

- Two musicians were responsible for the invention of color print film? Leopold Godowsky and Leopold Mannes were fascinated by photography. The two, who were full-time music teachers, worked together in Mannes' kitchen to produce an easy-to-use, practical color film. Their discovery earned them jobs at Kodak and their efforts resulted in Kodachrome film.

- The telescope was accidentally discovered in 1698 when Dutch eyeglass maker Hans Lippershey looked through two lenses -- one held in front of the other -- and realized that the image was magnified?

UPCOMING BACK TO SCHOOL PROGRAM

The Chicago Sun-Times Newspaper In Education department is excited to partner with the Anti-Defamation League to provide a four-week Newspaper in Education program on the Constitution and the First Amendment. Starting Tuesday, Sept. 5, this school page will feature additional information and activities on the importance of the Constitution and the First Amendment. A special educational section sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League also will be included in the program. Schools all across the Chicago metropolitan area in grades 8 to 12 are invited to participate at no cost.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right of all Americans to express their opinions. And according to the First Amendment Center, it was written because at the time of America's inception, citizens demanded a guarantee of their basic freedoms.

It is considered a blueprint for our personal freedom. Without the First Amendment, religious minorities could be persecuted, the government could establish a national religion and protesters could be silenced. The press would not to be able to criticize government and citizens would be unable to mobilize for social change.

For more information, or to sign your classroom up, please call the Educational Services Department at (312) 321-2280.

Robert K. Kjellander, a nationally powerful Republican with strong ties to the White House, emerged Friday as a key figure in an ongoing probe of corruption in Illinois.

Kjellander is identified as "Individual K" in a guilty plea by Stuart Levine, a political insider who describes an underworld of behind-the-scenes deal makers who wielded clout to bilk millions of dollars through two state boards.

Levine said he used his connections to steer a $150 million state pension deal to a firm represented by Kjellander, earning Kjellander a lucrative finder's fee. In return, Kjellander allegedly agreed not to bill Levine for lobbying work.

The plea deal does not accuse Kjellander of any wrongdoing, but the mention of him indicates the feds are interested in his actions.

Besides outing Kjellander, Levine provides new detail about alleged actions by Kjellander's former business partner, state GOP powerbroker William Cellini. He says Cellini, identified in the plea as "Individual A," and others schemed "to defraud" Illinois taxpayers. Among those others is Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a former top fund-raiser for Gov. Blagojevich.

'A PATTERN OF WRONGDOING'

The government indicted Rezko on Oct. 11, but Cellini has not been charged.

Blagojevich, who reappointed Levine to seats on state teacher pension and health boards, said Levine's plea proves he knew nothing about Levine's dirty deals and kickbacks. The plea does not accuse Blagojevich of any wrongdoing.

"Today's news reveals a pattern of wrongdoing by Stuart Levine that betrayed the trust of [former GOP] Gov. [Jim] Edgar, who first appointed him, and to all of us here in Illinois," Blagojevich said. "Anyone who violates the public trust should be held accountable for their actions."

Still, Levine's plea reaches into the governor's inner circle.

It places Rezko in the center of schemes to make money from pension deals by allegedly forcing companies to pay kickbacks and hide them as consulting fees.

It also accuses top Blagojevich fund-raiser Christopher G. Kelly -- "Individual B" -- of helping Levine, Rezko and Cellini shake down an investment firm seeking business with the state for $1.5 million in campaign contributions to Blagojevich.

Though Kjellander and Cellini are longtime Republicans, they have fared well under Blagojevich, a Democrat. Kjellander made $809,133 as a consultant on a massive state bond deal in 2003. The Cellini family's investment firm, Commonwealth Realty, has been entrusted with investing $340 million in pension cash since Blagojevich took office.

Levine admits schemes

Cellini and Kjellander did not return calls. A call to Kelly's lawyer was not returned.

Commonwealth issued a statement that the firm "is not aware of the [Levine] allegations but its employees are remaining focused on serving their clients' investment needs."

In his plea agreement, Levine, 60, of Highland Park admits to hatching the kickback schemes while he was a board member of the Teachers Retirement System (TRS), where firms competed for investment deals worth millions of dollars. He also detailed schemes he pulled while a member of the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.

Levine raked in "millions" from the crooked deals, according to his lawyer. Levine and others allegedly plotted to steal as much as $50 million though they actually pocketed much less.

"Stuart Levine was a legitimate hardworking and successful businessman before he got involved with these boards," Levine attorney Jeffrey Steinback said. "You can become intoxicated with the ether of power and the ether of money."

Under terms of his deal, Levine would serve 5oe years in prison, far less than the life sentence he could have faced. A federal judge either has to accept that prison term or reject the entire deal.

Pressure to cut a deal is now on Rezko, who prosecutors say faces at least 14 years in prison if convicted in just one of two cases against him.

Prosecutors have said they have substantial evidence against Rezko, including recordings where Rezko can be heard discussing allegedly illicit deals.;
