Preparation of PU/organoclay nanocomposites
The intercalated polyol/clay C20A and exfoliated polyol/clay C30B dispersions were prepared separately and then the two dispersions were mixed at a specified weight ratio to obtain polyol/clay dispersions with various exfoliation degrees. PU/organoclay nanocomposites with hard segment contents of 36 wt% and 26 wt% were prepared. The NCO/OH ratio was kept at 1.1:1 for every sample. The hydroxyl OH content of clay C30B was calculated according to the modifier concentration of C30B, ie 90 meq (100 g)-1 clay. Typically, 19.4 g of polyol and 0.6 g of clay were blended and stirred for 4 h at 80 °C. The polyol/clay mixture was blended with 0.85 g of 1,4-butanediol, 5.96 g of MDI and 0.03 g of Dabco-33LV as a catalyst at room temperature for 1 min and was vacuum-degassed for 3-5 min to remove the bubbles. Then the viscous prepolymer was poured into an O-ring metal mould and cured at 50 °C for 24 h and at 80 °C for 72 h to obtain the PU/organoclay nanocomposites.
Characterization
The liquid polyol/clay mixtures and the PU/clay nanocomposites were characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The liquid samples were put into a container and then mounted individually into a Philip-X'Pert X-ray diffractometer fitted with a goniometer detection device (anode 40 kV, filament current 35 mA). The solid PU/clay films were directly tested. Nickel-filtered CuK radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm was directed at the samples in their through direction. The goniometer scanned diffracted X-rays in the 2 range 1° to 10° at a scan speed of 1° min-1 and with a step size of 0.02°. transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was conducted with a JEOL EM11020 instrument. The ultrathin cryosectioning of the PU/clay samples was conducted at Birmingham University.
Tensile tests were carried out using a Hounsfield testing machine at room temperature. In the tensile mode, the specimens were stretched until break at a crosshead rate of 500 mm min-1. The stress-strain curves were recorded. The tensile strength, elongation, and modulus at 50 %, 100 %, 200 % and 300 % strain were the average values of five specimens. In the hysteresis mode, the specimens were stretched to 100 % or 200 % strain at a crosshead rate of 50 mm min-1 and then allowed to retract at the same rate to the unstretched state. The hysteresis (Hy), defined as the amount of energy dissipated during cyclic loading, was determined from the areas W1 (work done during stretching) and W2 (work done during retraction), ie Hy = W1 - W2. The hysteresis loss ratio Hy%, defined as the energy dissipated relative to the energy supplied on stretching, can be expressed as: 

In the stress relaxation mode, the specimens were stretched to 100 % strain at a crosshead rate of 50 mm min-1, and then held for 40 min. The stress decay over time was recorded. The relaxation ratio was defined as (0 - e)/0, where 0 is the initial stress at 100 % strain and e is the equilibrium stress. The relaxation rate was evaluated by fitting the test data to the formula developed by Cotton and Boonstra,[25] ie ft = f1.0t-n, where, f1.0 is the stress after 1 min of relaxation, n is the relaxation rate index of the material and t is time in min. The discrete relaxation time spectra were obtained according to the generalized Maxwell model.

Preparation of PU/clay nanocomposites with various exfoliation degrees
PU/clay nanocomposites with various exfoliation degrees were prepared by in situ polymerization. In the first step, the exfoliated and intercalated polyol/organoclay mixtures were prepared by mixing tri-hydroxyl-branched polyether polyol and two kinds of organoclays, C30B and C20A, respectively. The WAXD patterns of polyol/clay C20A and C30B liquid mixtures are shown in Fig 1. The d-spacing of original organoclay C20A is about 2.42 nm. After intercalation by branched polyol, the d-spacing of polyol/clay C20A expanded to about 4.1 nm. The d-spacing of original organoclay C30B is about 1.86 nm. After mixing with branched polyol at 80 °C for 4 h, no obvious peak was observed in the 2 range 1-10° in the pattern for polyol/clay C30B liquid mixture. This means that the d-spacing of clay layers possibly reached at least 8.8 nm. In this study we assumed it was an exfoliated structure because there was not enough interaction between clay layers at such a long distance. The disappearance of the WAXD peak in polyol/clay C30B dispersions suggests that the exfoliation process can occur at the mixing stage between polyol and clay. This is totally different from the conclusion in the extensively investigated epoxy system in which the exfoliation of clay layers occurs in the curing stage.[26][27]

In the second step, the weight ratios of the intercalated C20A/polyol and exfoliated clay C30B/polyol dispersions were adjusted to produce the polyol/organoclay mixtures with exfoliation degrees of 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. Here we reasonably assumed that for C20A the clay structure was in the form of 100% intercalation state, and for C30B it was in the form of 100% exfoliation state. The exfoliation degree (ED%) can be defined as the C30B weight percentage in the overall clay, ie ED% = WC30B/(WC30B + WC20A) × 100%. It must be pointed out that the exfoliation degree defined here is not an accurate value; in this study it was used as a relative comparison. The PU nanocomposites were formed by further in situ polymerization of polyol/organoclay mixture, chain extender and MDI. The WAXD patterns of PU nanocomposites for clays C20A and C30B are shown in Fig 1. The d-spacing of PU/clay C20A nanocomposite was reduced to about 3.5 nm from 4.1 nm. This means that after in situ polymerization of polyol and MDI, the d-spacing of clay layers was pushed back by the polymer. For clay C30B/PU, no obvious peak was observed in the 2 range 1-10°, suggesting that in situ polymerization did not alter the exfoliated structure of clay C30B in PU. Previously, Rhoney et al[10] reported the effect of processing method on the exfoliation process for organoclay C30B in PU. Figure 2 shows the TEM micrographs of PU/clay nanocomposites with clay C30B and with clay C20A. The results further confirm that clay C30B was in an exfoliation state and clay C20A was in an intercalation state in PU. The realization of intercalation and exfoliation of clay at the mixing stage provides a convenient method for preparing the PU/clay nanocomposites with different exfoliation degrees.

Effect of exfoliation degree of clay on the mechanical properties of PU/clay nanocomposites
Two systems with different hard segment contents of H = 36 wt% H = 26 wt% were employed. As a control experiment, the unfilled PU was studied and the mechanical properties are summarized in Table 1. The tensile strength and the modulus at various strains are shown in Fig 3 (H = 26 wt%) and Fig 4 (H = 36 wt%), and the elongation at break is shown in Fig 5. Compared with the unfilled PU, the addition of clay C20A or C30B improved the tensile strength, modulus and elongation for both the H = 26 wt% and the H = 36 wt% series, which suggests that both clays are effective reinforcing fillers for PU. The effect of clay varies with hard segment content. The reinforcement effect of clay on PU with a low hard segment content is more significant than that on PU with a high hard segment content. For example, at a hard segment content of 26 wt%, with the addition of 3 wt% clay, the tensile strength of PU nanocomposite increased by 45% from 8.3 to 12 MPa, the elongation at break increased from 722 % to 900%. In contrast, at a hard segment content of 36 wt%, the tensile strength increased only by 20%, and the elongation at break remained almost unchangeable. In addition, with increasing the exfoliation degree, the tensile strength and modulus at various strains increased and the elongation decreased for both the H = 26 wt% and the H = 36 wt% series. It is well known that fillers with a high aspect ratio will produce a stronger reinforcement effect.[28] as the exfoliation degree increased, the aspect ratio of clay increased, and the interfacial interaction was strengthened owing to the increase in the contact area between the polymer and the clay, and the reinforcement effect became more marked. 

 

Hysteresis in the PU/clay nanocomposites
Hysteresis loss is the amount of energy dissipated during cyclic loading. The tensile and tear strength and fatigue life are related to hysteresis loss.[19] Hysteresis can be understood by a spring and dashpot model. The spring represents the elastic response and the dashpot the viscous response, which is responsible for the hysteresis. From the molecules' point of view, hysteresis loss, or energy dissipation mechanisms, for crosslinked PU/clay nanocomposite include: (1) internal friction, including the friction between the macromolecular chains and the friction between the macromolecular chains and the clay; (2) breakdown of clay agglomerates; (3) breaking of weak crosslinks; and (4) breaking of the hydrogen bonds in the hard segment domains.[29-31] Fig 6 shows the typical hysteresis curves of PU nanocomposites subjected to 100 % strain. Table 2 summarizes the hysteresis loss, hysteresis loss ratio and the strain energy ratio of blank PU and PU/clay nanocomposites. For all the samples, the area of the hysteresis loop between the 1st and 2nd cycles reduced significantly, and changed a little for the 3rd and 4th cycles. Compared with the blank samples, the introduction of the clay raised the hysteresis loss (Hy) and hysteresis loss ratio (Hy%) regardless of the hard segment content and strain level. This is consistent with the results of Finnigan et al.[12] Also, increasing hard segment content led to an obvious increase in the hysteresis loss. Clearly, at a low hard segment content, clay has a more significant effect on the hysteresis loss and its ratio. The data in Table 2 show that an increase in exfoliation degree leads to an increase in Hy especially at a high strain, ie 200 %. At a hard segment content of 26 wt%, as the exfoliation degree increased, the Hy% first increased and then decreased. The Hy% reached the highest value at an exfoliation degree of 40 %, which is nearly a 1:1 weight ratio of clay C20A and C30B. The trend is similar at the two different strains of 100 % and 200 %. As we know, the breakup of filler aggregation during stretching is one main reason for hysteresis of elastomers.[22] When two different clays are mixed, owing to the different polarity of the surface modifier of clay, the adhesive interaction between the two kinds of clay particle could become weaker. This may explain the highest Hy% at a weight ratio of nearly 1:1 for clay C20A and C30B. The exfoliated PU nanocomposite, ie with ED% = 100%, had a lower Hy% than the intercalated one, ie with ED% = 0%. For the intercalated clay C20A, clay tactoids existed in the form of aggregates, and breakup of the filler structure occurred, leading to a high Hy%. At a hard segment content of 36 wt%, the change in the Hy% with exfoliation degree was not significant at the strains of 100 % or 200 %. As mentioned above, the effect of clay on the Hy% for different contents of hard segment is different. At a high content of hard segment, instead of the clay effect, the hard domain in PU will play a more important role for hysteresis loss owing to its high content and large size.
