The same test was performed for total duration. Over the course of a whole class
section, significantly more time was given to boys for the following discourse moves:
praise (F = 21.1, p &lt;0.001), acceptance (F = 13.8, p &lt;0.001), direction (F = 14.2,
p &lt;0.001), closed questions (F = 3.18, p &lt;0.05), and refocuses (F = 6.6, p &lt;0.05).
Boys also answered significantly more than girls (F = 15.8, p &lt;0.001). These
differences are the same differences as those found for the frequency data. It seems to
be the case then, that the number of discourse moves is different among boys and
girls, but generally not the duration of these moves (total duration is higher for boys
simply because the higher frequencies contributed to this, but the average length of
each discourse move is similar).
Impact of IWBs upon gender differences in classroom interaction
As reported elsewhere (F. Smith et al., 2005a), no significant differences between
whiteboard lessons and non-whiteboard lessons were found for the first year of whiteboard
use (in 2003). For example, boys were no more likely than girls to answer in
whiteboard lessons, or vice versa.

A two-way mixed ANOVA2 with one between-subject variable of "situation' (no
IWB 2003/IWB 2003/IWB 2004) and one within-subject variable of gender
(number of discourse moves directed to/initiated by girls or boys), was then used to
see whether another year with a whiteboard made a difference. Three discourse
moves were found to have significant interaction effects: the number of open questions
asked by the teacher; the number of answers given by students; and the
number of evaluations given by the teacher (specifically, it is the number of acceptances
which is higher).
It is clear that all three are linked in terms of the traditional IRF structure. In all
cases, the discourse moves relating to boys were significantly higher in the final year
of IWB use (in 2004). Table 6 shows the percentage increase in discourse moves for
the boys. The data show, for example, that teachers directed 69% more open
questions to boys than girls when using an IWB in 2004, compared to the reverse situation
in 2003 in lessons which did not use whiteboards (–11% difference). Therefore,
there appears to have been an embedding effect whereby changes in classroom interaction
only become apparent in the second year of IWB use. No differences were
found for the duration data.

Discussion
This paper set out to investigate gender differences in whole class classroom interaction
where IWBs were not being used, and to measure the impact of IWB use upon
gender differences in classroom interaction. The research focused upon literacy and
numeracy lessons in Year 5.
With regard to lessons not using IWBs, the frequency data showed that boys
received significantly more closed questions, direction, evaluation and refocuses;
boys also answered significantly more than girls. Boys' answers were praised and
accepted significantly more than girls. An indicator of pace was calculated by
summing up all of the discourse moves to boys and to girls. Pace with girls decreased
dramatically as the percentage of boys in class increased (this decrease was steeper
than would be expected if the relationship were proportionate).
These discourse moves may be higher in frequency with boys, but the average
duration of each move is similar between boys and girls. The total duration for each
of the following moves was higher with boys: praise, acceptance, direction, closed questions,
and refocuses. Boys' answers also took up more time in class than girls' answers.
Total duration is higher for boys simply because the higher frequencies contributed
to this: average length of each move remains similar between boys and girls.
No significant differences between whiteboard lessons and non-whiteboard lessons
were found for the first year of whiteboard use. However, open questions to boys,
their answers, and evaluation of their answers were significantly higher in the second
year of IWB use. There were no differences in the duration of these moves.
Overall the findings show that, at least in Year 5, there is significant gender
imbalance in classroom interaction, and that whiteboards seem to exacerbate this
imbalance. In earlier studies of whole class teaching (Mroz et al., 2000; English et al.,
2002; Smith et al., 2004), and in the broader study from which this paper originates
(F. Smith et al., 2005), we found clear evidence of directive teaching across all years
of the primary school. This was characterised by highly structured question, answer
and evaluation sequences (the IRF structure), direction, and explanation. In the
current study it was found that more of this directive teaching is aimed at boys than
girls (with more refocusing of boys too), and that IWBs increase directive teaching to

boys. From the viewpoint of girls in a whole class session, boys receive more teacher
attention, and the girls must listen to more directive teaching, which is aimed at boys.
Howe (1997), in her research review on gender and classroom interaction,
concluded that boys dominate "both physically and verbally' and boys are evaluated
more. Looking beyond primary school level, Drudy and Chathain (2002) found more
"acceptance, higher-order questions, criticisms, lower-order answers and pupil initiations'
associated with boys (p. 43) in Irish second-level schools. They refer to this
imbalance as a "performance gap' on the part of teachers which requires "remedial
action' (p. 34); while Hammersley (1990) has rightly cautioned against assuming that
"equal aggregate teacher attention between sexes is a good thing' (p. 126). It should
not be a goal for teachers to distribute their amount of attention (e.g. the aggregate
of discourse moves) evenly between the sexes; but teachers (and researchers) should
be questioning why types of attention differ so much between boys and girls, and they
should think beyond the classroom to the likely effects of such imbalance upon boys'
and girls' attitudes to learning and their expectations or inhibitions when partaking in
discussions. It is in this sense that the imbalance can be called an inequity. Of course,
the first step in this process is to make these predominantly subconscious biases
visible to teachers through self-awareness, reflection and information, as Martino
et al. (2004) argue. Research into dialogic teaching also emphasises that it is not
simply the quantity of interaction that is important but the quality, so that all pupils
are effectively engaged in the classroom discourse.
The finding that boys answer more in lessons which use IWBs is consistent with
Glover and Miller's (2001) finding that boys are more motivated and involved in
these lessons. However, the only other impact of IWBs involved more open questions
to boys and more evaluation. There was no evidence of boys becoming more involved
(than girls) in interaction which stimulates higher order thinking (e.g. probes, uptake
questions, curriculum spontaneous contributions). As the provision and use of
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) within schools increases (Prior
&amp; Hall, 2004), it is important to continue monitoring the differential impact of ICT
(e.g. internet, email, electronic discussion boards, more personal computers, and
video conferencing facilities) upon boys and girls in terms of participation in discussion.
This study also found that, as the percentage of boys in class increases, so does the
pace (or total number of discourse moves per hour) with boys: and since these
discourse moves are generally directive, the amount of directive teaching also
increases. The interesting aspect to this finding is that the decrease in pace with girls
shows a sharp decline (sharper than the incline in pace for boys) as the percentage of
boys increases. There is a 52% drop in the total number of discourse moves with girls
as the percentage of boys in class moves from under 40% to over 60%; however, there
is only an 11% drop in the total number of discourse moves with boys as the percentage
of girls in class moves from under 40% to over 60%. It seems that girls are more
inhibited than boys when they are outnumbered in class. Drudy and Chathain (2002)
also found that girls are less likely to answer or initiate interactions in class as the
male:female ratio increases, and they referred to this as a "comfort zone' issue.
It seems clear that future research needs to investigate gender and classroom interaction
from a number of different angles. First, there needs to be continued monitoring
of the changing classroom and the impact of new policies and technologies upon
classroom interaction: pedagogies as well as technologies are gendered (Lucey et al.,
2003). Second, teachers need support to achieve a greater awareness of the implicit
processes which can lead to imbalance in the classroom, particularly in relation to the
use of technology in the primary classroom (Jenson &amp; Brushwood Rose, 2003).
Structured observation, coaching and talk-analysis feedback may be useful tools in
encouraging this reflection (Temperley &amp; McGrane, 2005). Researchers must also
monitor the effectiveness of this reflection upon subsequent interaction patterns.
Finally, research needs to move beyond quantifying the gender imbalance and
towards understanding why it exists, which processes are behind it, and what impact
this has upon learning. For example, is it because: girls choose to remain silent
(Myhill, 2002); boys are more verbally outgoing; boys generally seek the teacher's
attention more; or because a small group of boys seek attention (either the teacher's
or that of their peers)?
The answers to these questions can only be established through the triangulation
of results from a range of methods, including: sophisticated video observation
methods which focus on the verbal and the non-verbal; recorded lessons where the
focus can be (simultaneously) upon the teacher, individual students, all students, or
groups of students; Stimulated Recall interviews with students and teachers which
might probe some of the participants' understandings of such interaction; and
sequential analysis of observational data to establish patterns in classroom interaction
which are not apparent from frequency and duration data.

1. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests for differences between groups (in this case gender)
but it controls for the effects of another variable (in this case percentage of boys present in
class).
2. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the variance of group means (e.g. the variance of
the three means for "no IWB 2003/IWB 2003/IWB 2004') with the variance of the values within
these groups.
