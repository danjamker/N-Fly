HOP OFF TO A BRITISH ISLE; 
EIGHT REMOTE PLACES TO ENJOY OUT OF SEASON

IT may be winter, but you can still go island-hopping. TINA EDISS has found some British isles that are wonderfully eccentric, wonderfully scenic - and great fun to visit out of season.
SEIL ISLAND, WEST SCOTLAND 
YOU'LL need to cross the Atlantic to get to the island of Seil but don't worry, it will only take a minute. Clachan Bridge, or the Bridge Over The Atlantic as it is known, has a span of just 72ft.
Built in 1792, this humped-back bridge was made high enough to allow sailing boats clearance so, as you reach the top, all you can see is the bonnet of your car.
Next to the bridge is the Tighan Truish Inn, which translates to the house of trousers. In the troubled days that followed the Jacobite Uprising, canny Scots would stop here to change out of their banned kilts and into trousers before crossing to the mainland.
The main village on the island is Ellenabeich where tiny, white-washed former slate-quarrier's cottages stand in neat terraces. It might seem familiar as scenes from the 1969 wildlife movie Ring Of Bright Water were filmed here.
WHERE TO EAT: Tigh an Truish (01852 300242, www.tigh-an-truish.co.uk) offer evening meals from pounds 6.
WHERE TO STAY: The Oban Caledonian Hotel (01631 563133, www.foliohotels.com) has B &amp; B from pounds 110 per double room per night.

ISLE OF PORTLAND, DORSET
THE Isle is joined to the mainland by Chesil Beach... but it does have a definite island feel. Some people come here to walk - while others just want to stand and stare, as the sea is wild here, especially down by the lighthouse at Portland Bill.
The clash of tides, known as the Race, are the fiercest in Europe and come roaring in to explode in a frenzy on the rocks.
The Isle is scarred from limestone quarrying. At one time there were 80 quarries, now only a few are left. Don't miss the Sculpture Park at the disused Tout Quarry.
WHERE TO EAT: The Lobster Pot (01305 820242) has main meals from pounds 7.95.
WHERE TO STAY: The Heights Hotel (01305 821361, www.heightshotel.com) has B &amp; B from pounds 46.50 per person based on two people sharing (minimum of two nights) until March. One-night stays available in January.

BURGH ISLAND, DEVON
YOU don't have to push the boat out to get to Burgh Island - but you might have to if you want to stay here in the famous Burgh Island Hotel. The tiny island is just 400 metres from the coast at Bigbury on Sea. At low tide you can get across on foot, at high tide you can catch the wonderfully weird-looking sea-tractor (pounds 1.50 each way).
Burgh Island Hotel has been fabulously restored in art-deco splendour. Add your name to the impressive guest list; Agatha Christie wrote some of her books in the Beach House, now a posh apartment. Noel Coward also stayed as did Edward and Mrs Simpson, flier Amy Johnson, Sir Winston Churchill and the Beatles.
WHERE TO EAT: Pilchard Inn, part of the hotel, has evening meals on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday for around pounds 15. Book in advance. Curry Nights on Fridays are popular. Light lunches, baguettes or soup from about pounds 5. Non-residents welcome.
WHERE TO STAY: Burgh Island Hotel (01548 810514, www.burghisland.com) has dinner/B&amp;B from pounds 340 per double room per night.

LIHOU, GUERNSEY
TINY Lihou lies off the west coast of Guernsey in the Channel Islands and can be reached at certain low tides. Access is by a cobbled causeway laid in the 1800s when seaweed was harvested as fertiliser. A tide timetable is posted at L'Eree on Guernsey or check out www.gov.gg. You can also take guided walks (pounds 5), call Jill Girard 01481 252403 for dates.
The 39-acre island is windswept and harsh, yet the grass is surprisingly soft underfoot. You can see the ruins of a monastery where a monk was murdered in 1304 and ponder on the mystery of 15 ancient skeletons found buried here.
If you want to stay overnight, you can rent the huge, recently-restored house. There's a well-equipped kitchen and amazing views from the sitting room. Upstairs sleeps up to three. You will need to take bedding, linen and foodstuffs, but these can be transported by tractor. You won't need bottled water, the water is drawn from the island's bore hole and is five times purer than tapwater.
WHERE TO EAT: The Imperial Hotel (01481 264044, www.imperialinguernsey.com) on the mainland at Rocquaine Bay offers lunches for around pounds 8 to pounds 11.
WHERE TO STAY: Rent the house for a minimum charge of pounds 200 per night or pounds 20 per person. To book, phone the Warden on 01481 266294, www.lihouisland.com

SHELL ISLAND, NEAR LLANBEDR, NORTH WALES
REACHED by a tidal causeway, the island can be visited at weekends during the winter months (Closed Jan/Feb). As the name suggests, the island is famous for the thousands of shells (around 200 varieties) that are washed up by winter storms.
In summer it is a busy family campsite, in winter it is popular for walking and bird watching. On a clear day you can see the mountain ridges of Snowdonia and, as the day comes to a close, you might be lucky enough to catch one of the island's fabulous sunsets.
At some low tides St Patrick's Causeway, or Sarn Badrig, a shingle reef that heads off towards Ireland, is visible.
WHERE TO EAT: The Shell Island Restaurant (01341 241453) has a good reputation for Sunday lunches, expect to pay pounds 12.50 for three courses. Book in advance.
WHERE TO STAY: Castle Cottage Restaurant (01766 780 479, www.castlecottageharlech.co.uk) has B&amp;B with dinner from pounds 150 per double room per night.

SPITBANK FORT, HAMPSHIRE
SPITBANK Fort in the Solent, a mile offshore from Portsmouth, was built in the 1860s as part of a ring of fortifications to protect Portsmouth from the threat of French invasion.
In 2002 it was the setting for Ant And Dec's Saturday Night Take Away - Banged Up With Beadle, which had Jeremy locked in the dungeons for six weeks.
Spitbank is all about having a good time with Sunday lunches and party nights all through the summer. For Christmas there are a number of medieval-themed par ties on Friday and Saturday nights.
Access is via water taxi, a 15-minute trip from Portsmouth or Gosport which may be cancelled in bad weather - but there are alternative dates in place just in case.
Once onboard you can party as hard and as loud as you like, the walls are 15ft thick and there are no neighbours near enough to complain! 
WHERE TO EAT: Party nights include supper, pounds 29.50 per adult. Book on 01329 242077, www.spitbankfort.co.uk
WHERE TO STAY: Express by Holiday Inn (0870 400 9670, www.hiexpress.co.uk) at Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth, has double rooms from pounds 79.95, with continental breakfast.

RATHLIN, NORTHERN IRELAND
THIS isolated island lies six miles from Ballycastle in Nor thern Ireland and just 16 miles from the Mull Of Kintyre in Scotland. It is hard to imagine that such a small island, just six miles long and one mile wide, could have so much history - but the evidence is visible on the landscape with standing stones, forts, ancient churches and crumbling ruins.
The fact that there are three lighthouses will give you an indication of how wild the seas can be, but Caledonian MacBrayne operate a year-round, 45-minute foot passenger service from Ballycastle across the Sea of Moyle to Church Bay on the island.
It is most famous for its connection with Robert the Bruce. He was hiding in a cave there, now known as Bruce's Cave, when he watched the spider that inspired him to try, try, try again.
Add to that the seabirds; kittiwakes, puffins and razor bills, the seal colony and stunning cliff walks and you have more than enough for a memorable visit.
WHERE TO EAT: The Coach House in the Londonderry Arms Hotel (028 2888 5255, www/glensofantrim.com) offers lunches from pounds 10.
WHERE TO STAY: Bushmills Inn (028 2073 3000, www.bushmillsinn.com has does B &amp; B in a double room from pounds 98 per room per night.

ST MARY'S ISLAND, WHITLEY BAY
THIS tiny island, once the home of hermits and the haunt of smugglers, is just north of Tynemouth. The island is a nature reserve with rock pools along the shore and grass lands on the cliffs.
You can only cross on the causeway when the tide is out, so check the dates and tidal information before you travel.
Once there you can visit St Mary's Lighthouse which dates from 1898, and if you climb the 137 steps to the top your reward will be some outstanding views of the north-east coast (weekends only in winter, phone 0191 200 8650 to check details).
There is also a visitor centre where you can learn the history of the lighthouse and the island, including the story of the murder of a Customs man near Smugglers Creek in 1722.
WHERE TO EAT: Sidney's (0191 257 8500, www.sidneys.co.uk) in Tynemouth offer a set menu from 12 - 2.30pm and 6pm-7.3pm, two courses for pounds 12 or pounds 15 for three.
WHERE TO STAY: The Grand Hotel, Tynemouth (0191 293 6666, www.grandhotel-uk.com) does B &amp; B in a double rooms from pounds 95 per night.

BROTHERS IN ARMS

THE STARS: Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, Robert Duvall.
THE STORY: In 1988, Brooklyn club manager Bobby Grusinsky (Phoenix) uses his mother's maiden name to distance himself from his police chief father Burt (Duvall) and promoted brother Joseph (Wahlberg).
When Joseph is injured by the Russian drug dealers working out of Bobby's club, Bobby goes undercover to reveal the depth of the gang operation, but puts himself and girlfriend Amanda (Mendes), as well as his family, in danger.
THE VERDICT: This stylish and moody crime drama makes for a nice contrast to the festive flicks, and while it might be modest in terms of its storyline, it is packed with impressive performances and does a wonderful job of capturing the brutal drug gangs scene of New York in the 1980s.
Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg are perfect as the battling brothers who never want to admit their bond, while gorgeous Eva Mendes is suitably sultry as Bobby's loyal Puerto Rican girlfriend.
Writer-director James Gray has crafted a gritty film which in the closing shootout scenes also has an unworldly beauty.
FINAL CUT
ELEGANT crime film is an enjoyably brutal drama. ***
Opens Friday, December 14
