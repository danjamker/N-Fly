Alcohol Deaths
Rates in the UK continue to rise
The alcohol-related death rate in the UK continued to increase in 2006, rising from 12.9 deaths per 100,000 population in 2005 to 13.4 in 2006. Rates almost doubled from 6.9 per 100,000 in 1991. The number of alcohol-related deaths more than doubled from 4,144 in 1991 to 8,758 in 2006. 

In 2006 the male death rate (18.3 deaths per 100,000 population) was more than twice the rate for females (8.8 deaths per 100,000) and males accounted for two thirds of the total number of deaths.

For men, the death rates in all age groups increased between 1991 and 2006. The biggest increase was for men aged 35-54. Rates in this age group more than doubled, from 13.4 to 31.1 deaths per 100,000 over the period. However the highest rates in each year were for men aged 55-74.

Death rates by age group for females were consistently lower than rates for males, however trends showed a broadly similar pattern by age. The death rate for women aged 35-54 doubled between 1991 and 2006, from 7.2 to 14.8 per 100,000 population, a larger increase than the rate for women in any other age group. As for men, the highest rates in each year were for the 55-74 age group. 

Between 2005 and 2006, for both sexes, rates remained the same for those aged 15-34 and increased for those aged 35-54 and 55-74. There were small falls in the rates for those aged over 75, down 8 per cent for men and 6 per cent for women.

Breast Cancer
Incidence rises while deaths continue to fall
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in England. In 2004 there were around 36,900 new cases diagnosed. This represents 32 per cent of all cancers in women and is a rate of 121 cases per 100,000 women. 

Four in five new cases are diagnosed in women aged 50 and over, with the peak in the 55 to 64 age group. 

Around 10,300 women died from breast cancer in England in 2004, a rate of 28 deaths per 100,000 women. It is the second most common cause of cancer death in women, after lung. 

One in nine women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives. Most of the known risk factors for breast cancer relate to a woman's reproductive history such as early first period, late first pregnancy, low parity and late menopause. Oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), obesity and increased alcohol consumption also increase the risk.

The breast screening programme was introduced in 1988 with the aim of reducing the number of women dying from breast cancer. Originally, breast screening was offered every three years to all women aged between 50 and 64, and to women aged 65 and over on request. From 2001, this began to be extended to women in England aged 65 to 70, and to women over 70 on request. Full national coverage for this older age group was achieved by the end of 2004. In 2004-05, three quarters of women aged 50-64 invited for screening in England underwent screening for breast cancer. Around 1.5 million women are screened each year. 

Incidence rates increased by 81 per cent between 1971 and 2004, and by 13 per cent in the ten years to 2004. 

Earlier detection and improved treatment has meant that survival rates have risen. Five-year survival was 81 per cent for women diagnosed in 1999-2003 in England. Survival from breast cancer is higher than that for cervical cancer and much higher than for the other major cancers in women - lung, colorectal and ovarian. For women diagnosed in 2001-03, 72 per cent are likely to survive for at least ten years. Survival is still decreasing more than ten years after diagnosis, however, and only 64 per cent are likely to survive for at least 20 years. 

Death rates gradually increased up to the mid-1980s and then began to fall around the time screening started. By 1998 mortality was around 20 per cent lower than it would have been without screening (based on predictions of pre-screening rates in various age groups). Falls occurred in all age groups, but were greatest in women aged 55 to 69.

Cigarette Smoking
Slight fall in smoking prevalence

In 2005, 24 per cent of adults aged 16 or over in Great Britain smoked cigarettes, indicating a slight fall in the prevalence of smoking among both men and women since the late 1990s.

The proportion of adults who smoked cigarettes fell substantially in the 1970s and the early 1980s – from 45 per cent in 1974 to 35 per cent in 1982. After 1982 it declined gradually until the early 1990s, levelling out during the 1990s. It then fell smoothly from 28 per cent in 1998/99 to 24 per cent in 2005.

In July 2004 the Government set a new target to reduce the overall proportion of cigarette smokers in England from 28 per cent in 1996 to 21 per cent or fewer by 2010 – with a reduction from 32 to 26 per cent or less among manual occupation groups. In England in 2005, 29 per cent of those in manual occupational groups were cigarette smokers, compared with 33 per cent in 1998. Together with the fall in overall prevalence, this indicates some progress towards targets.

While men are still more likely than women to smoke cigarettes, the gap has narrowed. In 1974, 51 per cent of men and 41 per cent of women smoked. In 2005, 25 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women were cigarette smokers.

Cigarette smoking continues to be more common among adults aged 20 to 34 than among other age groups. In 2005, 32 per cent of adults aged 20 to 24 and 31 per cent of adults aged 25 to 34 were smokers compared with 14 per cent of those aged 60 and over.

The proportion of men who were heavy smokers (on average 20 or more cigarettes a day) fell from 14 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 1998. Among women, the proportion fell from 9 per cent to 7 per cent over the same period. Since then the proportions have remained virtually unchanged, although there is a suggestion of a slight downturn in the last couple of years. The proportion of adults smoking fewer than 20 cigarettes a day has been around 17 to 19 per cent of both men and women since 1998. 


In 2005 just over two thirds (68 per cent) of cigarette smokers in Great Britain said that they wanted to give up, but 56 per cent said it would be difficult to go without smoking for a whole day. Overall, 16 per cent of smokers said they had their first cigarette of the day within five minutes of waking up: this varied according to how much respondents smoked, ranging from only 2 per cent of those who smoked fewer than 10 a day to 33 per cent of those who smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day.

Gender Pay Gap
Narrowest since records began
The gender pay gap (as measured by the median hourly pay excluding overtime of full-time employees) narrowed between 2006 and 2007 to its lowest value since records began. The gap between women's median hourly pay and men's was 12.6 per cent, compared with a gap of 12.8 per cent recorded in April 2006. The median hourly rate for men went up 2.8 per cent to £11.96, while the rate for women increased by 3.1 per cent to £10.46.

The largest difference was in the South East region, where women's median pay was 15.9 per cent less than men's. The smallest gap was in Northern Ireland, at 2.8 per cent.

On the internationally comparable measure based on mean earnings, women's average hourly pay (excluding overtime) was 17.2 per cent less than men's pay, showing a decrease on the comparable figure of 17.5 per cent for 2006. 

In 2007, median weekly earnings of full-time employees for women of £394 were 21 per cent less than those for men (£498), unchanged from 2006.

Women's weekly earnings, including overtime, were lower than men's. This was partly because they worked fewer paid hours per week. Based on hourly earnings excluding overtime, women's earnings increased more slowly across the bottom 10 per cent of the distribution than men's, with a growth of 3.0 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent for their male counterparts. The hourly earnings of the top 10 per cent grew by 2.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively.

Although median hourly pay provides a useful comparison between the earnings of men and women, it does not necessarily indicate differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs. Pay medians are affected by the different work patterns of men and women, such as the proportions in different occupations and their length of time in jobs.

Internet Access
61% of households had access
In 2007, nearly 15 million households in Great Britain (61 per cent) had Internet access. This is an increase of just over 1 million households (7 per cent) over the last year and nearly 4 million households (36 per cent) since 2002.

In 2007, of all UK households including Northern Ireland, over 15 million (61 per cent) had access to the Internet. This was an increase of nearly 1 million households (7 per cent) since 2006. The regions with the highest level of access were the South West and London, both with 69 per cent. The regions with the lowest access levels were Yorkshire and the Humber, the North East and Northern Ireland, each with 52 per cent. 

Eighty four per cent of UK households with Internet access had a broadband connection in 2007, up from 69 per cent in 2006. As in 2006, London had the highest level of households with broadband Internet access at 60 per cent. Of London households with Internet access, 88 per cent had a broadband connection. Northern Ireland remained the region with the lowest level of households with broadband Internet access, at 40 per cent of all households. Of Northern Ireland households with Internet access, 78 per cent had a broadband connection.

Travel to School
Over half of 5 to 10 year olds walk to school
In 2006, 52 per cent of 5 to 10 year olds walked to school. This is similar to the proportion walking to school from 1995 to 1997 (53 per cent). The proportion of 11 to 16 year olds walking to school was also similar in 2006 (41 per cent) to 1995-97 (42 per cent).

In 1995-97, 38 per cent of trips by 5 to 10 year olds were by car. This rose slightly to 41 per cent in 2006. Among 11 to 16 year olds, 20 per cent travelled to school by car in 2006, the same proportion as in 1995-97.

Secondary school children are far more likely than primary school children to go by bus, rail or cycle to school.

Private and local bus travel accounted for 6 per cent of journeys to and from school by 5 to 10 year olds in 2006 and 31 per cent of trips by 11 to 16 year olds. Just 1 per cent of 5 to 10 year olds cycled to school, compared with 3 per cent of 11 to 16 year olds.

Primary school children travelled to school alone (unaccompanied by an adult) for 5 per cent of trips to school in 2006 compared with 9 per cent in 1995-97. Among secondary school children, this figure rose slightly from 41 per cent in 1995-97 to 43 per cent in 2006. 

The average length of a journey to school increased from 2.0 to 2.4 kilometres among younger children between 1995-97 and 2006. It increased from 4.7 to 5.4 kilometres among 11 to 16 year olds.

Since trips to school take place at around the same time each day they have a major impact on levels of congestion in some areas. At the peak travel to school time of 8.45am on weekdays in term time, nearly two in ten (18 per cent) car trips by residents of urban areas was generated by the 'school run' in 2006.
