Hero and Ptolemy
Hero of Alexandria's Catoptrics7 introduces the core mechanical analogy of reflection into the optical tradition itself via analogies between projectile motion and visual rays. He links the dynamics of physical projection to an object's tendency to rectilinear motion, arguing that what moves most swiftly moves rectilinearly.8 He provides an atomistic account of matter through which he seeks to make the compactness of walls comparable with that of mirrors. Just as stones or balls do not find entry through the compact surfaces of walls, so neither do rays upon mirrors.9 Moreover, he ascribes a force of motion to the stone and argues that the force of motion in the case of visual flux also causes its rebounding according to the law of reflection at equal angles, for the combined paths of incidence and reflection are always the minimum possible distance between eye, surface and object. Swift physical projection entails not only visual rays' rectilinear motion but also their reflection at equal angles on encountering a compact obstacle.10
Early in his Optics,11 Ptolemy extends this mechanical analogy of visual rays by providing an explanation for the qualitative differences in acuity of vision and intensity of illumination in terms of their rays' angles of incidence or impact (as opposed to differences due to a greater or lesser number of such rays). The variable intensity of such rays is explained as instances of a general physical principle governing the variable impact forces of falling bodies.12 Later, he analyses the resistance which obstacles offer to projectiles in perpendicular and tangential motion in terms of perpendicular resistance (or opposition) to explain the physical basis of the geometrical law of reflection:
The relationship of equality between the angles … is easily adduced, as is the fact that it follows a natural course. For projectiles are scarcely obstructed by objects they strike at tangents, whereas they are obstructed to a considerable extent by objects that resist them [directly] along the line of projection. Accordingly, when anything stands directly in the way of these projectiles and stoutly resists them, it interrupts and opposes the line of projection extending to the origin [of motion], just as walls obstruct balls that strike them at right angles. But obstacles [disposed at a tangent] pose no obstruction at all, just as curved bucklers do not obstruct arrows. It should be borne in mind that this explanation extends to all sorts of moving objects, and it should be understood that they all act in such a way. The action of the visual ray itself must therefore follow this rule, and any of the rays that approaches a mirror and then bounces back from it must maintain the disposition that occurs in the paradigm case – i.e. that the angle formed by the line normal to the mirror at the point of reflection and the line of incidence be equal to the angle formed by the same normal and the line of reflection.13
Ptolemy here proposes a physical explanation for the equality of angles in terms of the degree of resistance projectiles encounter on impact. Perpendicular incidence entails maximum resistance, and the object rebounds back along the same line of projection (for example, a ball directly against a wall). Tangential incidence entails no resistance, and the object's motion parallel with the obstacle's surface is unaffected (for example, an arrow along a bow-handle). In oblique incidence, the degree of resistance determining a projectile's rebound angle from the obstacle is determined by its incident angle upon the obstacle. Taking this physical explanation as a general rule covering "all sorts of moving objects', Ptolemy includes the motion of a visual ray, such that the magnitude of its deviation from impact at right angles to the obstructing surface is also the magnitude of its deviation from rebound at right angles to the obstructing surface.14 Here, reflection is taken to be the paradigm case of rebound and must therefore follow exactly the general rule governing such physical phenomena, i.e. the geometrical law of equal angles.
Ibn al-Haytham
The physico-mathematical analysis of reflection and rebound in terms of physical projection was further developed via Ibn al-Haytham's dynamical approach in his Optics. 15 In rejecting the extramissionist theory of vision and its concept of visual rays,16 al-Haytham focuses on the reflection of physical light. His dynamical analysis of reflection as a rebound phenomenon thus becomes fully applicable to material rebound. Like Hero, al-Haytham bases his physical explanation of reflection at equal angles upon the force of rapid motion persisting in light and its encounter with a resisting surface.17 Like Ptolemy, he appeals to the perpendicular rebound of a ball-like body in the case of natural, downward motion; however, his example of violent (projectile) motion is an arrow being shot horizontally against a mirror; that is, against the very same polished surface from which light rebounds.18 This clearly indicates that his dynamical explanations of rebound and reflection are conjoined. He then elaborates upon Ptolemy's conception of oblique incidence as a mean between two orthogonal extremes, positing that motion along this oblique line has two components: one perpendicular to the repelling surface, the other parallel to it. He first explicates this via implicit reference to the geometry of image location; that is, as if the body were to pass through the obstacle's surface unhindered (see Figure 1). However, unlike the Problemata's appeal to similar angles formed above and below the surface line, al-Haytham here argues that the oblique motion of a body or light ray below the surface would maintain the same perpendicular and parallel components it has above the surface:
When the body descends along a sloping line, the line of descent falls between the perpendicular to the surface of the polished body (passing through that body) and the line in the surface orthogonal to this perpendicular. And if the motion were to penetrate beyond the point of its incidence, finding free passage, this line would fall between the perpendicular passing through the body and the line in the surface orthogonal to the perpendicular, and it would maintain the same measure of position with respect to the perpendicular passing [through the body] and the other line orthogonal to that perpendicular.19
Al-Haytham's clear geometrical formulation of Ptolemy's physical intuitions of the forces involved in oblique rebound is original. How he achieved this is unknown, yet a kinematically identical analysis of compound rectilinear motion within the Greek tradition was available to al-Haytham through Hero's Mechanica:20 this is the parallelogram rule.21 Hero resolves a geometrical point's motion along a diagonal line into two perpendicular components, and also applies this at a specific location (position) along the line. The compatibility of the parallelogram rule's representation of diagonal motion and the geometry of oblique incidence makes al-Haytham's linking of the two a reasonable explanation for his geometrically refined analysis of oblique incidence and reflection/rebound within optics. In this way, al-Haytham would effectively transfer the parallelogram rule's kinematical analysis of a geometrical point's rectilinear motion from the geometrical foundations of ancient Greek mechanics to the optical analysis of rectilinear impact and rebound/reflection, positing a dynamical interpretation of the rule's perpendicularly related, rectilinear components of motion.22
Al-Haytham is thus able to conduct a sophisticated analysis of rebound/reflection. Firstly, he interprets the components of oblique rectilinear motion as dynamical magnitudes. Secondly, he demonstrates that the perpendicular component of motion/force in oblique incidence is alone opposed by the surface, which resists the motive force of the body or light ray and so repels it with equal perpendicular magnitude, while the parallel component, since it in no way opposes the surface, is neither diminished nor altered by the impact. Thirdly, he demonstrates that the ratio between a body's/ray's two components of motion/force remains constant both before and after impact; that is, no matter what position on the line of incidence one chooses, the one position sharing the same magnitude of perpendicular motion/force on the line of reflection will also share the same magnitude of parallel motion/force.23
Though this is a thoroughly mechanical treatment of reflection based upon a sophisticated analysis of the rectilinear impact and rebound of material bodies, al-Haytham is careful not to claim a complete identity between rebound and reflection, for rebounding bodies cannot maintain the rectilinear line of reflection due to their natural tendency to fall downwards, whereas light has no such tendency. Light reflection is the paradigm case showing how bodies would move/rebound if they did not possess a heavy nature.24 Al-Haytham also lacks an atomistic view of light as the locomotion of material particles. Rather, it is the rectilinear transmission of its power or form of heat through a material medium, modelled on the action of fire upon the surrounding air and nearby objects.25 Nevertheless, his physico-mathematical treatment of reflection to explain the rebound at equal angles of light and bodies from resisting surfaces represents a high watermark in the conceptualization of collision phenomena unsurpassed until the seventeenth century.
Concretization: light and laws of motion
Harriot: a doctrine of material reflexions
In the late sixteenth century the non-Aristotelian and Neoplatonic natural philosophies of Giordano Bruno and Francesco Patrizi reasserted the explanatory importance of light outside optics by each establishing light as one of their basic theoretical principles.26 This no doubt influenced the so-called Northumberland School27 by reinforcing the theoretical importance of optical principles for understanding the (re-emergent) atomistic view of Nature. Initially, the rectilinear propagation of particles and force was seen as the most fundamental issue, so principles of light metaphysics were employed.28 When the issue of the rectilinear impact/rebound of elementary particles became important, principles of light mechanics came more into focus. Interest in such principles grew with the popularity of "table billiards' among the aristocracy in Europe around the 1570s and 1580s.29 Moreover, in 1572 al-Haytham's Optics was published for the first time, together with Witelo's work.30 Someone studying the mechanical principles of rectilinear incidence and reflection/rebound contained in these works might easily see their relevance to the rectilinear impact and rebound of billiard balls. The first person to do so was Thomas Harriot.31
By the late 1590s Harriot had carefully studied al-Haytham's Optics and Witelo's Perspectiva, had begun measuring refraction in water and glass,32 and declared an intention to "commence war against the Aristotelians'.33 Reading al-Haytham's book, Harriot would have found that the Arab scholar had taken seriously Ptolemy's suggested grounding of the geometrical law of reflection in the physics of mechanical rebound,34 analysing the latter to explain the cause of light's reflection in line with the former. Besides the perpendicular composition of motions discussed above, Harriot undoubtedly came across several dynamical principles of mechanical rebound: (i) "the force of reflected motion will be proportional to the force of incident motion and the force of resistance'; (ii) "the distance covered by reflected motion relative to the obstacle will be proportional to the distance covered by the incident motion relative to the obstacle'; (iii) "The second [rebound] motion is acquired by the moveable (or mobile) from [this] same resistance',35 where the incident motion is annulled; (iv) "the force of resistance is proportional to the force of the first [incident] motion and proportional to the absence of any [additional] effect of the obstacle'; and (v) resistance/repulsion in rebound acts only along the perpendicular.36 These dynamical insights concern the rebound of movables against hard surfaces, whether by natural (usually perpendicular) or violent (usually oblique) motion – just as light falls upon reflecting surfaces either perpendicularly or obliquely.
Harriot had also read Kepler's Optics,37 which emphasizes the methodological principle of conjoining the motion of light with the motion of bodies.38 Kepler gives a dynamical explanation of repercussion covering both light reflection and mechanical rebound,39 employing the principle of composition of motions,40 and stresses the equality of action and effect in his physical explanation of the geometrical law of reflection.41 Crucially, he goes on to provide a geometrical demonstration of his argument, employing both the image location diagram of Euclid's demonstration of the law of reflection in his Catoptrics (see Figures 1 and 4) and the generalization of its principles from light to bodies – found explicitly in the Pseudo-Aristotelian Problemata 42 and, implicitly, in al-Haytham's Optics.
