Getting work

There are many situations in which you could be looking for work, and everyone has different needs, skills and responsibilities. Fortunately, there are lots of different kinds of job out there, and a range of help available. This section tells you about the support you might be able to get. 

Work that suits your needs 

If you cannot or do not want to work full time, there are other options. Here are some examples. 
* Agency work: you could work in a job for a set length of time – usually as part of a particular project or to fill in for a permanent member of staff. 
* Part-time work: a good way to fit work around other responsibilities while getting money and experience. 
* Flexible working: sometimes employers will agree to flexible working arrangements. This might mean choosing your start and finish times, or working longer hours on some days so you can take more time off. 
* Term-time working: being off during the school holidays could be ideal if you have children and they are at school. 
* Holiday working: a practical option if you're still studying during college term time. 
* Job-sharing: sometimes 2 people can share a single full-time job. Look out for jobs advertised as job shares. Or, if you want to share a job with someone you know, you could always suggest the idea to your employer. 
* Self-employment: working for yourself offers flexibility and the right type of challenge for some people. But you will take on extra responsibility – for example, paying your own income tax. 
* Voluntary work: working without pay is one way to get work experience and find out more about an area that interests you. 

Ways into work 

If you are searching for a job, where should you look? And how do you convince an employer that you are the right person if you are interested in a position? 

Where to look 

There are three ways to keep in touch with the latest vacancies through Jobcentre Plus.

Other tips for finding work 

Newspapers and the internet 
Check the national and local press – most papers have a job section each week. There are also many websites where you can search for jobs. 

The direct route 
Is there a particular company you would like to work for? Write a letter asking if they have any job vacancies – and include a curriculum vitae (CV). Even if there's nothing suitable, ask them to keep your details on file in case something comes up in the future. It might be worth calling them first to see who the best contact is. You could also search on the internet to see if they have a website for more information. 

Go to a jobs fair or careers fair 
Jobs fairs are a good chance to speak to local employers about the opportunities they have at the moment. Visit www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk 
to see if there are any local events coming up. Or, keep an eye on the local and national press for information about careers events in your area. 


Applying for a job 

CVs, applications and interviews 
There are lots of books offering practical advice on writing a CV, filling in application forms and performing well in interviews. You might find useful information in your local library, and there are useful tips online at: 

* Worktrain: www.worktrain.gov.uk  
* Careers Scotland: www.careers-scotland.org.uk , and 
* Careers Wales: www.careerswales.com or www.gyrfacymru.com 

Programme Centres 
You may be able to get free help with job applications at one of our Programme Centres, along with practical advice on looking for jobs, removing barriers to getting and keeping a job, and going back to work. Programme Centres provide stamps, stationery, newspapers and access to the internet. Many offer learning modules to improve your interview skills and phone techniques, and to develop your experience in how to research, apply for and get a job. 

To find out whether there's a centre near you and whether you are eligible to use its services, call your local Jobcentre Plus office or Jobcentre. 


10 tips for improving your chances 

1. Take advantage of the help that's out there. In this leaflet, we've included next steps and contact details for organisations that might be able to help. You could also visit our website at www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk 
2. Make your CV the best possible. Think about what might make a potential employer give you the job rather than someone else. You could even look at other people's CVs to get ideas. 
3. Sometimes personal circumstances might make it difficult to work. Why not get help to find ways around them? See the ‘Financial and practical help' section (pages 29 to 43). 
4. Find out if training would help you improve your chances. You might even be able to work and train at the same time. See ‘Training for the future' (pages 21 to 27) for more information. 
5. Keep an open mind to the opportunities out there – there may be possibilities you haven't thought of before. Make sure you look at the sections on training and financial help in this leaflet (pages 21 to 27 and 29 to 43). 
6. If you have an interview, try to find out as much as you can about the employer. It's always helpful to have a bit of background knowledge. Remember, the employer may have a website. 
7. Always dress smartly if you're going to an interview or contacting an employer face to face. 
8. Think what you might be asked in your interview and how you might reply. You may want to ask questions as well. 
9. Think long-term. If you know where you want to be in a couple of years' time, look for a job that will help you on your way. 
10. Find out if you can get financial help into work. See page 16. 


Making contact with local employers 

We have good links with employers across the UK, and there are a number of other ways to get your ‘foot in the door'. 

Work Trial 
Work Trial is a programme that gives you the chance to try out a job with an employer for up to 15 days. You'll carry on getting your benefits while you're on the trial, so it's a risk-free way of finding out if a position is right for you. If your employer offers you a job at the end of your Work Trial period and you accept it, this does not mean that all financial help will end – you may be eligible for some in-work benefits and tax credits. See page 16 for more on tax credits. 

For more information on Work Trial, visit www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk or contact your local Jobcentre Plus office or Jobcentre. 

Apprenticeships 
Apprenticeships are often a great way to earn a salary or receive an allowance while learning new skills and gaining qualifications. Many employers from a range of industries are helping people to develop in this way. In England and Wales, apprenticeships are available to people aged between 16 and 24. In Scotland, there is no upper age limit. 

* In England: visit www.apprenticeships.org.uk or call 08000 150 600. Or, find out more from Jobcentre Plus. 
* In Scotland: visit www.scottishenterprise.com/modernapprenticeships or call Careers Scotland on 0845 850 2502. 
* In Wales: visit the Education and Learning Wales site (www.elwa.org.uk) or www.careerswales.com. Or, call learndirect on 0800 100 900. 

New Deal 

New Deal aims to give unemployed people the help and support they need to get into work. You get a personal adviser, who is your point of contact throughout the programme. The personal adviser takes time to understand you – your experiences, interests and goals – so a plan can be prepared to get you a suitable job. The adviser can: 

* help you apply for jobs 
* tailor a scheme to meet your circumstances 
* give you advice on training options and any financial help you might be able to get 
* provide information on other local opportunities, like volunteering 
* work out how much better off you could be in work, by providing advice about the financial support that's available 
* help you get access to childcare information services and specialist childcare 
* give you advice on help with childcare costs and travel costs to help you look for work 
* support you when you start work, and 
* help you apply for in-work benefits. 

The New Deal programme is also available to the partners of people receiving certain benefits. 

Interested? Find out what other people have got out of the programme on the New Deal website at www.newdeal.gov.uk. Or, speak to a New Deal adviser on 0845 606 2626. 

Visit a jobs fair 
Jobs fairs are a good chance to speak to local employers about the opportunities they have at the moment. Visit www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk to see if there are any local events coming up. 

Financial help into work 

If you find a job and you're earning a low income, you might be able to get Working Tax Credit. This means you pay less tax if you meet certain conditions – so you take more money home at the end of the week or month. You might also be able to get tax credit if you have children. To find out about tax credits, visit www.hmrc.gov.uk  or call 0845 300 3900. 

If you've been claiming Income Support (page 31), you may also be entitled to other financial help when you start work. 

* Job Grant: a tax-free, one-off payment of between £100 and £250 for couples with children. 
* Mortgage Interest Run-on, Council Tax Extended Payment and Housing Benefit Extended Payment: help for people who would lose benefits when they start work. 

For more information, visit www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk or contact your local Jobcentre Plus office, Jobcentre or social security office. Contact details are on the website and in your local phone book. 

What happens to my benefits when I find a job? 
You might have to give up some of your benefits if you find a job, but you could also get other kinds of support – such as Working Tax Credit (see page 16). 

If your job doesn't work out and you have to claim benefits again within 12 weeks, you might be able to put in a claim to get the same benefits you were getting before you started work. We can help you make sure you don't lose out financially and tell you how your benefits might be affected. 

Is work the only option? 

If you're out of work, training or further education could be a worthwhile step towards achieving a long-term goal. Training isn't just for people leaving school. There's always the chance to develop a career, learn a trade, or work towards a professional qualification.
