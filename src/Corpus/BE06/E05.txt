Method

1. In a pan, heat the milk and cream with 1 tbsp of the 40g caster sugar. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks with the remainder of the 40g sugar, then whisk in the two flours, a third at a time. Slowly pour the scalded milk onto the yolk paste, whisking well. Return to pan and whisk over a gentle heat until thickened and smooth. Cook for 1 min, then spoon back into the large bowl. Cover with cling film and cool. 
2. Peel the mango, roughly chop the flesh and discard the stone. Soak the dried mango for 10 mins in hot water, then drain. Halve the passion fruits and scoop the flesh and seeds into a blender or food processor. Add the fresh and soaked mango. Blitz well until smooth. Mix in the alcohol. You should have around 550ml purée. Beat into the cooled egg mixture. Set aside until ready to bake. Can be kept in fridge for 2 days. 
3. Brush the insides of eight 150ml ovenproof dishes or ramekins evenly with the soft butter, using upward strokes. Coat well with half of the chocolate, shaking out excess, then chill to set. 
4. Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Remove any grease from a large bowl, by rubbing with lemon juice, then whisk egg whites until thick and glossy. Gradually whisk in 100g sugar to form a glossy meringue. Beat a third into the fruit base, gently fold in the rest. 
5. Place the prepared dishes on a baking tray. Spoon the mixture into each dish right to the top. Scrape the tops level with a palette knife and sprinkle with remaining chocolate. Bake for 20 mins until risen and golden on top. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately - you may find it useful to use a fish slice to lift the hot dishes.

Method

1. Mix 50g butter and flour into a paste (known as beurre manié, see notes, below). Chill to firm for about 30 mins. Heat milk to boiling point with the onion, spices and bay leaf, then simmer gently for 5 mins. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Taste milk for flavour. 
2. Strain the milk into a large pan, pressing down on the onion to extract the maximum of flavour. Place the pan back on the heat and gradually whisk in the butter paste, adding in small pieces until you have a thick sauce. 
3. Season, then leave to cool for 3-4 mins. Whisk in egg yolks, grated gruyère and cheddar, plus two-thirds of the parmesan. Add the Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Check seasoning, leave to cool. Can be made 2 days ahead - bring to room temperature before continuing. 
4. Brush the insides of a soufflé dish (approx 20 x 8cm deep) with the remaining 25g butter, using upward brush strokes. Coat the base and sides evenly with some parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. Chill to set. Cut the gruyère slice into diamond shapes. 
5. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Coat a large, grease-free bowl with the lemon juice (see tip, below). Whisk the egg whites in the bowl, then whisk a third of them into the cheese mixture, to loosen. Carefully fold remaining egg whites into cheese mixture until well mixed, but still light. 
6. Spoon half the mixture into prepared dish. Dot with brie and top with remaining mixture. Gently level the top. Arrange gruyère on top, scatter with remaining parmesan. Bake for 10 mins. Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, bake for 15-20 mins. The soufflé should be evenly risen and slightly wobbly. Serve immediately - the centre will be soft, but will thicken slightly when served. 

Gordon's tips 
Eggs are critical for your soufflé to rise properly. Make sure you beat yolks into the hot base mixture 1-2 mins after cooking, then allow to cool. Beat the whites to stiff, but not dry, peaks. Add the whisked egg whites in two stages - a third beaten into the base to loosen it, and the rest gently folded in. This stops the mixture from splitting. 
Gordon's tips 
Use a balloon whisk and spatula for mixing bases, and an electric mixer for firm egg whites. The slightest amount of grease prevents egg whites firming; a clean bowl and a squeeze of lemon juice rubbed around cleans it sufficiently. 
Gordon's tips 
It's essential to heat the oven before baking and get the oven shelf position sorted first. Don't open the oven door until almost the end of cooking. A cooked soufflé can be left in the oven for a few extra minutes if the temperature is turned right down. 
For the base of a savoury soufflé 
Make a flour and butter paste (a beurre manié). This is whisked into hot, well-flavoured milk - add extra flavour with curry spice, paprika or cayenne. Beurre manié paste can be made in bulk, rolled into a sausage and chilled or frozen. Then you can cut chunks to use for other soufflés. 
Gordon's tips 
I add extra flavour with chunks of ripe brie or wilted spinach for savoury soufflés, and fruit purées on the base of sweet ones. 
To make a sweet soufflé 
Use a base of crème patisserie - a thick egg yolk and flour custard. To prevent it boiling too soon, add a little sugar to the milk while it heats. 
To help the mixture rise 
Brush the dish sides with softened butter, using even, upward brush strokes (from bottom of dish to rim - see step 4). If you like, chill to set, brush again with more butter, then coat in grated parmesan and coarsely ground black pepper. For sweet soufflés, use ground nuts or grated chocolate. Chill the coated dish to set before filling.

Method

1. Making macaroni cheese is a bit of a juggling act, so it's easier if you get a few things prepared ahead. Finely grate all the cheeses, keeping them separate. Tear the bread into pieces and whizz in a food processor to coarse crumbs. Mix 25g of the cheddar and one-third of the parmesan into the breadcrumbs. Toss the rest of the cheeses together and set aside. Thickly slice the tomatoes. Butter a dish, about 30 x 20 x 5.5cm. Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. 
2. Put a pan of water on to boil. Tip the macaroni into the boiling water, stir and bring it back to the boil. Simmer for 8 mins, or cook according to pack instructions, stirring occasionally to stop it sticking. While this is cooking, start the sauce. 
3. Warm the milk in a jug in the microwave (or in a pan). Melt the butter in a pan (big enough to take the macaroni as well), then stir in the flour. Cook for 1 min, stirring, then take off the heat. Pour in one-third of the warm milk and beat well with a wooden spoon until smooth - it is quite thick at this stage. Add another third - it may go a bit lumpy, but keep beating well and it will go smooth again. Pour in the final third of milk and keep beating until smooth. 
4. When the macaroni is done, tip it into a colander and put it briefly under very hot running water to keep it separate. Drain. Put the pan of sauce back on the heat and cook, stirring, until thickened and smooth. Lower the heat and simmer for about 4 mins until glossy, stirring every now and then. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese and mustard, then beat in 5 tbsp milk, or enough to give a slack coating consistency. Taste and season (you shouldn't need much salt). If the macaroni is sticking at all, put it under the hot tap again, then stir to separate. Drain well, then gently mix it into the sauce and stir to coat completely. If necessary, adjust the consistency again with milk. There should be enough sauce to coat the macaroni thickly and liberally. 
5. Tip the macaroni cheese into the buttered dish, scatter over the cheesy crumbs and lay the tomatoes casually over the top. Heat through in the oven for 12-15 mins until beginning to bubble around the edges. Grill for 3-5 mins to brown the crumbs. Let it all settle for 1-2 mins, then serve while still piping hot. 
Thai Chicken Curry

Ingredients

* shallots , or 1 small onion 
* 1 stalk lemon grass 
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil 
* 3-4 tsp red Thai curry paste 
* 4 boneless and skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces 
* 1 tbsp fish sauce 
* 1 tsp sugar , brown is best 
* 4 freeze-dried kaffir lime leaves 
* 400ml can coconut milk 
* 20g pack fresh coriander

Method

1. Peel shallots or onion and cut in half from top to root. Lay the cut sides flat on a board and thinly slice. Very finely slice the lemongrass, starting at the thinner end, stopping towards the base when it gets tough (often described as 'woody' and white in the centre). 
2. Heat the oil in a wok or large saucepan for a couple of minutes until the oil separates (it looks more liquid at this point). Add the shallots or onion. Fry for 3-5 mins, until soft and translucent. Stir in the curry paste and cook for 1 min, stirring all the time. 
3. Add chicken pieces and stir until they are coated. Add the fish sauce, sugar, kaffir lime leaves and coconut milk. Bring slowly to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 mins until the chicken is cooked. Stir the curry a few times while it cooks, to stop it sticking and to keep the chicken submerged. 
4. While the chicken is cooking, strip the leaves from the coriander stalks, gather into a pile and chop very roughly. Taste the curry and add a little more curry paste and salt if you think it needs it. Stir half the coriander into the curry and sprinkle the rest over the top. Serve with Thai jasmine or basmati rice.
