3.3. LD between SNPs
C2 SNPs were in strong LD in cancer and BPH patients (D?  0.87). LD between C1 SNPs was also strong (D?  0.77). LD between C2 and C1 SNPs was weaker (D? = 0.42–0.60). F/f30875 demonstrated no LD with group C SNPs (D? &lt; 0.11). 
3.4. C2-1 and C2-2 haplotypes
The frequencies of many haplotypes comprising less common C2 and C1 alleles were small. For example, in men with BPH, the frequency of two copies of the C2-2/C1-2 A-C haplotype was 20.6% (Table 3) while that of G-T was only 4.5%. Similarly, 31.3% of BPH men had two copies of C1-1/C1-2 C-C (Table 3) while only 9.1% had two copies of T-T. To allow study of the association of two compared with one haplotype copies, we accordingly only considered the association of haplotypes comprising wild type alleles with risk. We also combined men with high probabilities (&gt;0.4) of particular haplotypes with those definitely having one copy (probability = 0.5). For example, the EM-algorithm scored patients with C2-1 GC and C2-2 AG as having probability = 0.497 of one G-A haplotype copy. They were combined with those with one haplotype copy. Table 3 shows that one (age-adjusted odds ratio = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.17–2.58) or two (age-adjusted odds ratio = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.09–2.65) copies of G-A were associated with increased risk (reference, no copies). In men stratified by sunbathing score &lt;3 or in the very low exposure group, values of the age-adjusted odds ratio for one and two G-A copies increased.

3.5. C1-1 and C1-2 haplotypes
Table 3 shows C-C was not associated with a significantly altered prostate cancer risk relative to those with no copies in the unstratified group but in men with sunbathing scores &lt;3 and in the very low exposure group, C-C was associated with increased risk. 
3.6. C1 and C2 haplotypes
Men with C2 and C1 heterozygote genotypes had a probability &lt; 0.4186 of one copy of the haplotype comprising each wild type allele and were combined with those having a haplotype probability = 0.5. Haplotypes comprising C1-1 and C2-1 or C2-2 SNPs were not associated with risk in the unstratified group (Table 3). Table 3 shows that each haplotype comprising C2 and C1 SNPs was associated with risk in men in the low exposure group, values of the age-adjusted odds ratio for possession of one and two copies of G-C and A-C increased. 
3.7. Association of C2 and C1 SNPs on risk
To determine if the association of C1 SNPs with risk was determined by LD with C2-2, we examined the impact of four SNP haplotypes in men with sunbathing scores &lt;3. Four possible haplotypes were sufficiently frequent for analysis (frequency &lt; 0.06). Table 4 shows G-A-C-C (cancer cases frequency = 0.455) but not C-G-C-C (cancer cases frequency = 0.133) or G-A-T-T (cancer cases frequency = 0.065) were associated with risk indicating that SNPs in both C2 and C1 mediate risk. Various combinations of 3 of the SNPs in G-A-C-C were significantly associated with risk; odds ratios for associations of ACC and GAC with risk were similar.

3.8. C2, C1 and F/f30875 genotypes
Combinations of F/f30875 with G/C3436, G/A3944, C/T20965 or C/T30056 genotypes did not exert an additive effect in men with sunbathing scores &lt;3; C1-2 TT/FF (4 men with BPH, 3 men with cancer, age-adjusted odds ratio = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.06–1.94), TT/Ff (8 men with BPH, 6 men with cancer, age-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.06–0.78) and TT/ff (3 men with BPH, 3 men with cancer, age-adjusted odds ratio = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.06–0.75) all conferred reduced risk of cancer (because of small numbers of men only TT/Ff achieved significance). 
4. Discussion
VDR SNPs appear to mediate prostate cancer risk by a gene-UVR interaction [7], [8] and [9] though few markers have been assessed in haplotype block C and assessing life-time exposure to UVR is difficult. We have for the first time examined if SNPs located between G/C3436 and CC30875 mediate risk and by attempting to identify a genuinely very low exposure group, determined if the association is UVR-dependent. BPH was used as comparison group as the condition is part of normal ageing. Histologically the condition is described by epithelial and fibromuscular hyperplasia and importantly, it is not associated with increased prostate cancer risk. Importantly, these men had been investigated for possible prostate cancer. Studies in Caucasians indicate that VDR genotypes are not associated with prostate volume. Indeed, we found no significant differences in VDR genotype frequencies in BPH men and similarly aged females and males without lower urinary tract symptoms [5] and [6]. 
In the context of the UVR/prostate cancer risk hypothesis, the VDR gene is a strong susceptibility candidate. GG3944 and CC30875 have been associated with risk [5] and [7]. Studies in malignant melanoma also show GG3944 is protective [8]. These associations are plausible as the SNP is a putative GATA-3 site. Halsall et al. [8] proposed AA is associated with reduced Th-1 cytotoxic response to cancer cells as GATA-3 protein promotes polarization to Th-2 and A, but not G, fulfills the core sequence of a GATA-3-binding site. T30875 may be more transcriptionally active than C30875 [3]. Data regarding associations between block B SNPs and risk are discrepant though we reported that neither a C/T48200 substitution in intron 3 nor T/t65013 in exon 9 were associated with prostate cancer risk [5]. These data indicate the importance of block C SNPs and suggest markers may be identified in C1, a region that has not been assessed. The two SNPs studied are in strong LD with other markers in this sub-region [4]. 
We used aspects of UVR exposure as surrogates for chronic vitamin D status. Thus, a large Finnish study comprising 622 prostate cancer cases and 1451 controls has reported a U-shaped relationship between pre-diagnosis serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and prostate cancer risk [9]. We did not measure serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in our subjects firstly, because of seasonal variation in levels and secondly, because serum concentrations, post-diagnosis may not reflect levels years earlier when the process of carcinogenesis was initiated. However, we recognise that assessing the intensity/duration of exposure to sunlight during life is problematic. Thus, questionnaire-derived data are subject to recall bias in often elderly subjects and even substantial periods outdoors may not allow adequate vitamin D synthesis. For example, while exposures of only 10 min at midday may allow adequate synthesis in sunny climates throughout the year, no synthesis occurs during winter in northern Europe [10]. John et al. [7] assessed chronic exposure using an index based on the difference in reflectometer-determined pigmentation in the less exposed underarm skin (constitutive pigmentation) and widely exposed forehead (facultative pigmentation) though this approach has been criticised [11] and, body sites differ in their ability to synthesise vitamin D with the trunk being more effective than the head/neck. Thus, particular exposure patterns such as sunbathing may be more effective than longer periods outside with only the face exposed. We collected data on aspects of exposure linked with prostate cancer risk [2]. Cumulative exposure/year assesses occupational and recreational activity, sunbathing allows exposure of a large skin area and holidays in hot climates can allow continuous, intense exposure. Individually, these parameters may not fully describe low/high exposure; limited time in the sun (hours/year) might allow adequate vitamin D synthesis if sufficient area is regularly exposed around midday [10]. The parameters were weakly correlated indicating each assessed different aspects of exposure and all contributed to an overall index. Accordingly, we studied men with low exposure by all three measures and assumed these subjects had chronically low vitamin D status. 
C2-2 GG and C2-1 CC were associated with reduced risk in the total group though the impact of these SNPs and C1-1 TT and C1-2 TT was more evident in men with low exposure. Thus, compared to the high exposure group, odds ratios were always lower in each of the low exposure groups defined by a single parameter. The extent of difference between the low and high exposure groups was not always large explaining why the impact of &lt;1100 h/year exposure was missed in previous studies on GG3944 [5] and [6]. In high exposure groups based on one of the parameters, there were few associations between genotypes and risk. As expected [6] and [7], CC30875 was associated with increased risk in men with &lt;1100 h/year exposure though this association was not significant in men with sunbathing scores &lt;3 and in those who took regular foreign holidays. The observation that the SNPs conferred reduced risk in subjects with low exposure was more evident in men who had sunbathing scores &lt;3, exposure &lt;1100 h/year and no foreign holidays. Though relatively small, significant associations between each genotype and risk were observed in this group. These demonstrated smaller odds ratios than those in analyses of men stratified by a one parameter alone suggesting a combination of parameters best identified men with chronically low vitamin D levels in whom the protective effect of the less common alleles was best revealed. Possibly, wild type alleles encode proteins that function optimally with vitamin D levels in the reference range. 
We investigated if each SNP was associated with risk or if associations resulted from LD. C1-1 and C1-2 are intronic and do not have known functional implications. As expected LD between C2 and C1 SNPs was weaker than that between markers in each region. No LD between F/f30875 and other markers was observed [3] and [4] indicating that associations between this SNP and phenotype result from its functional consequences. Analysis of haplotypes indicated C2 and C1 markers contributed to risk. Thus, G-A-C-C but not C-G-C-C or G-A-T-T, was significantly associated with risk. We did not identify interactions between F/f30875 and any block C markers. This study shows the importance of block C SNPs in determining susceptibility to prostate cancer. This effect is most evident in men with very low levels of exposure. Of the SNPs assessed only G/A3944 appears likely to affect function. The basis for associations with C1 markers is unclear though is presumably with a marker(s) in the block C region. 
Several studies suggest prostate cancer risk is influenced by a vitamin D mediated, gene-UVR interaction [2], [6], [7] and [12]. We interpret our data as showing that the consequences of the SNPs studied are only clearly apparent in men with markedly low levels of exposure. In the case of SNP C2-2 these were previously missed in men stratified only by hours exposure/year. These findings indicate the importance of examining data for environmental effects as relevant markers may be missed. They are therefore, relevant to other potentially vitamin D-related diseases. Interestingly, the haplotype structure of the VDR gene is different in Africans and Europeans [4]. Comparative high resolution analysis shows that Europeans have well defined LD blocks with little variation between nationalities while Gambians have shorter LD blocks with more tagged SNPs required to map the gene. Indeed, data from the International HapMap project [13] shows markedly different VDR genotype frequencies in Africans and Europeans. We could speculate these findings reflect differences in vitamin D availability in well exposed compared with less exposed populations.
