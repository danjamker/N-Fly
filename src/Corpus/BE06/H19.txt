The Framework for National Statistics sets out the roles and responsibilities for Ministers. In 4.1.7 the Framework says: 
4.1.7. Departmental Ministers, including the Minister responsible for ONS... authorise Heads of Profession for statistics and their staff to make a full professional contribution to National Statistics activities and authorise access to all data within their control for statistical purposes across government subject to confidentiality considerations and statutory requirements

This guide aims to help the Government Statistical Service (GSS) meet this clear requirement of government by addressing some of the confidentiality and statutory requirements for sharing data for statistical purposes. It is clear that this responsibility has been poorly recognised in many departments.
In 2001 the Government set out its vision for engaging with deprived neighbourhoods, including the aims of delivering economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality education, decent housing, and better health.

In order to meet its objectives, a number of Policy Action Teams (PATs) were established. PAT 18 was given the task of developing a cross-government strategy to provide current and relevant information on local areas. The original PAT18 recommendations were published in April 2000 in its report Better Information. A number of the recommendations were accepted as policy and ONS was asked to take the lead in some of the key areas. These include:

- Government should attach a high and early priority to delivering a coherent cross-government information policy and strategy, with particular emphasis on social exclusion.
- There should be adequate safeguards to ensure proper protection of individual-level data at all stages in the process [of collecting and publishing information].
- A single organisation, ONS, should be the operational focus for synthesising and disseminating Neighbourhood Statistics. It should act as a focal point for all administrative and survey data held by departments, Local Authorities and other agencies.
- The ONS should promote good practice in data collection, data sharing and data use. ONS (on behalf of the GSS), and in conjunction with the Information Commissioner, Local Government Association (LGA) and the Home Office should prepare guidance on what sharing of statistical data is currently allowed and not allowed, with examples of good practice.
- Government departments, LGA and all related agencies which are subject to legislation in respect of data collection, protection or sharing should carry out an audit of their relevant powers and functions with a view to clarifying their practice.

As part of an audit exercise following adoption of the recommendations, it was stated that ONS, working with the GSS, should develop a guide on the issue of data sharing. This document is part of the ONS response to these commitments.

Background

The National Statistics Code of Practice recognises that sharing and combining data is one way of reducing the burden on data suppliers and extending the range of statistics available. It recognises that the act of matching records requires acceptance in a political sense, as well as at a professional level, and that this will often require others to endorse matching proposals before they begin. The Code also recognises that these enhanced datasets may be more disclosive and that maintaining confidentiality is paramount. This commitment applies to all respondents, be they individuals, households or businesses. Data sharing must therefore take place within a framework designed to honour this commitment. It should also be borne in mind that sharing extracts of administrative data under suitable governance arrangements might be less intrusive to privacy than the alternative of additional large statistical surveys. In the right circumstances, these principles lead to both public services and the privacy of individuals being improved by sharing data.1
In the past it has been perceived that the public have reservations about the data they provide being passed from one organisation to another. This is not always a correct perception. For example, research carried out by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has shown that the public expect data to be shared provided those granted access to the data use them for a purpose consistent with its original collection.2 (See Annex D). Most importantly, using administrative records for advancing official statistics is well-recognised in most countries as a key trusted and compatible use, and that its appropriateness does not need to be tested at every application. In the United Kingdom, sharing data originally provided for administrative purposes for the production of Neighbourhood Statistics and other National Statistics is not incompatible with the original purpose – indeed this important principle is found in section 33(2) of the Data Protection Act. (See Section 33 text in Annex B).3

The purpose of the guide

The first purpose of this guide is to lead the reader through the legal framework surrounding the sharing of data. It cannot provide authoritative legal advice, but it will help departments decide if legal advice is needed and, if so, over which questions. The guide highlights, step by step, the matters that data providers need to consider before data can be shared for statistical purposes. Links are provided to other documents, which give more detail on the concepts raised in this guide. 
The guidance provided applies to the sharing of both microdata (unit-level data) and aggregates. It is a principle of data protection that the amount and level of shared data should be no more than what is needed for processing. This applies equally to other non-personal data.

This introduces the second purpose of the guide. There are risks, either actual or perceived, when data is shared. Producing official statistics using shared sources is therefore a risk management activity, not a risk avoidance activity. To manage risk, it is necessary to know where risk arises and to have a mechanism in place that, for each instance of sharing data, checks for and confirms compliance with the law and the National Statistics Code of Practice. It is also necessary to be able to audit data-sharing activity to confirm compliance, or to investigate potential breaches of the law or the Code. The guide suggests a governance framework for data-sharing for statistical purposes.

Data Sharing for Statistics

In the past, when records were kept on paper, punched card, or magnetic tape, it was often easier to assemble a new database than to access one that already existed in another department or authority. The opposite is now true. It is technically easier to access a database that already exists than to create and populate a new one. This is most particularly true for multi-topic databases. The issue that now faces statisticians is how to exploit the advantages of electronic records while guaranteeing the confidentiality that data providers can reasonably expect.

The terms ‘data access’ and ‘data sharing’ are often used interchangeably to refer to the use of information by more than one organisation or individual. The exchange of data may involve several organisations each contributing and receiving data or just one researcher using one dataset belonging to a particular institution. Reciprocal exchanges are not always lawful, or proper. For example, taxation authorities provide tax information for improving official statistics to ONS, and it is expected that this will increase in the future. The individual records from statistical surveys of business, or of the population census could never be provided to taxation authorities for non-statistical purposes, without undermining public confidence in statistical confidentiality.

Within the context of National Statistics, ‘data sharing’ will generally be reserved for those relatively rare occasions where a statistical inquiry is initiated by joint survey partners, or where a common data resource is equally and jointly owned by two departments. It is likely the survey respondents or data providers would be informed of the joint ownership of the data, and most of the legal issues will have been addressed at the time the collection was initiated.

More common, and the activity this guidance is most relevant to, is where a source collected or acquired by a data owner is made available to another authority under certain limitations of use. In these cases, ownership remains with the organisation or organisations that collected the data and/or maintains the legal obligations to the data. This is ‘data access’.

A number of advantages arise from providing access to data for statistical purposes. The most obvious is the potential savings in burden and compliance costs in not having to collect the same information twice. Another is accuracy. Administrative databases will often cover the entirety of a given population, where a conventional statistical survey may cover only a small part. Using data collected through administrative channels can also provide more focused information on specific populations that would be difficult to reach through surveys. This is important when government policy is increasingly targeted at relative differences at the local level rather than at the sub-national or national level. Administrative sources of data may improve the relevance and timeliness of a statistic.

Sharing data to improve statistics and reduce respondent burden is consistent with government policy. The Government’s Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) (now the Strategy Unit) presented a report called Privacy and data sharing: the way forward for public services. The report’s recommendations were soon adopted as government policy, and DCA provide advice and resources on their website to help departments deliver better public services in this way.4 This guide is intended to enable official statisticians across government to give effect to this policy shift, and recognise the evolving nature of the broader context within which statistical activity takes place across the UK. It also recognises the particular partnerships with statistical units in devolved administrations.

ONS has worked on this policy through the DCA’s Data Sharing Practitioners Group. We have also provided DCA with the case for improving statistics through sharing data (see Annex D). The case argues that the current legislative framework for sharing data for statistics is overly complex, given that our products cannot identify individuals, nor cause any direct harm or distress to individuals. We will continue to argue that new legislation to provide for data sharing would help produce the statistics that public authorities need to improve their public services.

It is important to share statistical data with trusted users in the commercial and academic sectors. Much policy development in government is founded upon research done outside central government departments, and such research feeds back vital quality information to the producers of National Statistics. ONS has developed a risk-management mechanism for access to its microdata that aims to provide data to those who need it within a risk management regime. This Microdata Release Procedure is our response to the demands of the Code of Practice, but also meets the stewardship requirements found in the recommendations in the PIU report.
For more information on the ONS microdata release arrangements, please contact ONS Legal Services (see Annex C).

Legal Issues

It is a matter for the data owner to ensure that when access is given to another party, the sharing is lawful. For personal data, the ‘owner’ will be the Data Controller, as defined in the Data Protection Act.
This section takes the data owner through the fundamental questions of law that should be answered before sharing takes place. These are:
- What is the status of the data?
- Is there the necessary administrative power to share these sort of data?
- Is the Human Rights Act applicable, and, if so, is the sharing compliant with Article 8 – Right to respect for a private and a family life?
- Is there a legal duty of confidentiality owed to the data, and, if so, will the proposed sharing of the data breach this ‘duty of confidence’?
- Should information be shared under the Freedom Of Information Act?
- Is the data ‘personal data’, and, if so, will the data sharing comply with the Data Protection Act?
- Is there statutory provision, or statutory prohibition, for the sharing of these data?
