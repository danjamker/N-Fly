During the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the fair-haired
boy of serious American music was Edward MacDowell, the first native
composer to become internationally famous. Only twenty-one when he
was praised by Liszt, his works were published soon afterward and
frequently performed in both Europe and America. Theodor Thomas,
Arthur Nikisch, Anton Seidl, and other important conductors added
MacDowell to their repertoire, as did Ignacy Paderewski, Teresa
CarrenËœo, and many of the leading pianists of the era. The most influential
American critics, including James Gibbons Huneker, Philip Hale,
and Henry T. Finck, acclaimed him as the country's chief contributor to
music. Joachim Raff, Jules Massenet, and Edvard Grieg applauded him,
and young American composers took pride in his stunning success and
hoped to emulate him. His breakdown at age forty-five (he was born in
1860, not 1861) and his illness of almost three years was a major blow
to American music.
It was not surprising that a biography of MacDowell, about whom
so much had been written, appeared less than a year after his death in
1908. But what is surprising is that no thorough, musically authoritative,
balanced biography has yet appeared. Edward MacDowell: A Study
(1908), by the then young music critic Lawrence Gilman (1878 - 1939),
does not pretend to be a full biography, as the title indicates. Only
about half of its fewer than two hundred small pages is strictly biographical
and some of it, including MacDowell's birthdate and illness, is
inaccurate. The second half of the book, dealing with MacDowell's
work, is musically sound though dated, but it has been criticized as
being too favorable to MacDowell and unfair in its comments on other
American composers of the period. Alan H. Levy's Edward MacDowell:
An American Master (1998) the most recent biography of the
composer, is a little longer and contains a fuller picture of his personality
and his tribulations with Columbia University, but it, too, is not free of errors and is the work of a cultural historian rather than a musicologist.
The definitive, critical biography of MacDowell remains to be written.
"In years to come," Marian Nevins MacDowell wrote her husband's
closest friend, composer Templeton Strong, on 4 June 1914, "someone
may think it worth while to gather material for a new life [of
MacDowell]." She herself wrote her memoirs and carefully saved papers
and other memorabilia indispensable for a thorough biography of her
husband, but she refused to make them available, during her lifetime, to
several potential biographers (including John Erskine) who enlisted her
cooperation. After her death in 1956, her archives passed into the
hands of her longtime companion and foster-daughter, Nina Maud
Richardson, who, she had hoped, would undertake the biography of
herself and MacDowell. Perhaps Miss Richardson intended to at one
time, but realizing eventually that she had neither the training nor the
strength for such a project, and unwilling, I think, to reveal certain facts
about MacDowell, she gave much of the material to the Library of
Congress. (Several years after her death in 1969, the Library acquired
the rest of it.)
In 1965, having completed a biography of MacDowell's friend and
critical champion, James Huneker, about whom I had corresponded
briefly with Mrs. MacDowell not long before she died, I thought of
writing a biography of MacDowell and then of his widow, but eventually
abandoned both projects. But I did write a less ambitious, still unpublished,
study of MacDowell and Huneker. While revising the manuscript,
I suddenly realized why there had been no adequate biography of
MacDowell. Now, after extensive research, I am convinced that he was a
victim of syphilis and that Mrs. MacDowell wanted to bury the fact with
her husband.
In all but one of the published accounts of MacDowell's mental and
physical breakdown that I have seen, the breakdown is described
vaguely and mysteriously. Gilman writes: "There were indications of an
obscure brain lesion, baffling but sinister. . . . A disintegration of the
brain-tissues had begun - an affection [sic] to which specialists hesitated
to give a precise name, but which they recognized as incurable."
According to Gilman, MacDowell "began to manifest alarming signs of
nervous exhaustion" in the spring of 1905. Gilman says nothing about
a horse-cab accident, which MacDowell's friend, the writer Hamlin
Garland, mentioned in his diary in the fall of 1904: "The immediate
contributing cause of his breakdown was a fall in the street - or rather an accident in the street. He was struck by a cab, so his wife tells me,
and the concussion stunned him so that he was dazed for some time. He
was able to walk home, but this shock, coming upon him at a time
when he was worn with his teaching and suffering from his controversy
with Columbia [University], undoubtedly caused the collapse."
(MacDowell had resigned from Columbia early in 1904 and had engaged
in public recrimination with president Nicholas Murray Butler and the
trustees.) Yet when Garland issued a press release about MacDowell's
condition in November 1905, he did not refer to any accident.
MacDowell himself wrote to Templeton Strong on 4 January 1904,
that he had strained his right wrist in a "street car collision"; but if this
was the accident that bulked large in hindsight, it did not seem very
serious to MacDowell at the time, for he added, in the same letter,
"we are in fine health and spirits." Though she did not date it,
Mrs. MacDowell supplied details about this accident (or another one?)
in her unpublished memoirs, written long afterwards. It happened, she
recalled, when MacDowell was escorting his parents to a streetcar, and
she included the important point that the wheels of the cab crossed his
spine. In an unpublished letter to Mrs. Robert Underwood Johnson,
written on 19 June 1905, Mrs. MacDowell mentioned the "accidents" to
which "the doctors are beginning to attach much importance"; but what
they were - or what the other one was - she does not say. Margery
Morgan Lowens, author of an excellent doctoral dissertation on
MacDowell, tried to find police records of an accident involving
MacDowell but was unsuccessful. On 4 October 1905, it was probably
Henry T. Finck, music critic of the New York Evening Post and an old
friend and admirer of MacDowell (Gilman's book is dedicated to him),
who gave the first public account of the horse-cab accident: "A year ago
last spring, Mr. MacDowell, while crossing the street one evening, was
run down by a cab; the horse had slipped on the sleet, and the driver
was unable to check it. The wheels passed over the composer's neck,
and evidently injured the spinal nerves." Another old friend of
MacDowell's, T. P. Currier, confirmed the incident but dated it in the
spring of 1905 rather than 1904. An accident could have played some
part in MacDowell's illness, but it was not the main cause.
In November 1905, Garland stated that MacDowell's doctor, an
"eminent specialist" (his name was not given) had concluded that the
composer's "oversensitive, highly wrought brain [had burned] itself away
in overwork." Such an opinion is medically dubious, but overwork at
Columbia was, indeed, the cause publicly pinpointed by Mrs.
MacDowell. The first book on MacDowell to appear after Gilman's,
Elizabeth Fry Page's slight, sentimental 1910 panegyric, Edward MacDowell: His Work and Ideals, also attributes his death to "a mental
collapse brought on by overwork." That this was not the real cause
was suggested much later by John Erskine, who reported that those who
had studied with MacDowell at Columbia could not understand his
breakdown "in spite of explanations offered by Hamlin Garland and
others."
The only published account I know of which hinted that
MacDowell had syphilis was James Huneker's. In his moving article on
"The Passing of Edward MacDowell," written eighteen months before
MacDowell died, and published in the New York Herald on 24 June
1906, Huneker seems at first to accept overwork as the reason for
MacDowell's breakdown. The composer was "reckless of the most precious
part of him, his brain," Huneker writes. "He killed that organ by
overwork. . . . He burned away the delicate neurons of the cortical cells."
Then comes this sentence: "He suffers from aphasia and locomotor ataxia
[italics mine] has begun to manifest itself." Elsewhere in the article, he
makes two allusions intended, no doubt, for the cognoscenti. Referring to
MacDowell's piano teacher, Karl Heymann, Huneker remarks that
Heymann "went quite mad and died young in an asylum." And describing
MacDowell's symptoms, he reports that
he reads slowly and, like the unfortunate Friedrich Nietzsche, he rereads
one page many times. I could not help recalling what Mrs. Elizabeth
Foerster-Nietzsche told me in Weimar of her brother. One day, noticing
that she silently wept, the poet philosopher exclaimed: "But why do you
weep, little sister? Are we not very happy?" MacDowell is very happy and
his wife is braver than Nietzsche's sister.
Huneker was far more interested in and knowledgeable about the
sex life of artists than most Americans were in 1906. He had read the
studies of his friend Havelock Ellis and those of other sexologists, had
gossiped about the sexual peccadilloes of celebrities, and later (in 1913)
even wrote a newspaper article about the latest research in the treatment
of syphilis. As the Musical Courier's "Raconteur" from February
1888 to October 1902, he had probably retailed in his column more
scandals about musicians than any man in America. He had heard, I
suspect, that Heymann was a victim of syphilis.
The source of his information is unknown, but considering how
little has yet come to light about Heymann after MacDowell stopped
studying with him in 1880 or 1881, one is not surprised that Huneker's
statement about him is largely incorrect: Heymann did not die young,
nor did he die in an insane asylum; according to his death certificate (which does not list the cause of death), he died on 5 December 1922,
at the age of sixty-nine in a hospital in Haarlem, the Netherlands.
This does not mean, of course, that he might not have spent time in an
asylum. Gilman states that by 1881, when Heymann left the Frankfurt
Conservatory, he "had already begun to show symptoms of the mental
disorder which ultimately overcame him." He may have been under
care by early May 1884, when MacDowell visited him in Wiesbaden.
Thereafter Heymann seems to disappear, and he could have been in an
institution. After MacDowell himself broke down, his nurse Anna Baetz
recorded in her diary that he used to speak of Heymann as being "in a
madhouse," a fact which, Baetz added, Mrs. MacDowell confirmed.
Huneker, at any rate, apparently discovered his mistake, for when he
reprinted the Herald article in his book Unicorns (1917), he deleted the
reference to Heymann.
With Nietzsche, whose life has been studied thoroughly, Huneker
was on firmer ground. He probably knew by 1906 that Nietzsche's insanity
and death were caused by syphilis. In the one essay on Nietzsche he
had already published (and, indeed, in the two he wrote afterward)
Huneker, to be sure, did not state that Nietzsche had syphilis; overwork
or eye trouble were the causes he seemed to accept. He had even
described as "careful and convincing" a now discredited study of
Nietzsche's illness which appeared early in 1904, by Dr. George
M. Gould, the well-known ophthalmologist, who maintained that bad
eyesight was responsible for Nietzsche's ill-health and denounced the
"silly and nauseating attempt of Moebius to fasten upon [him] the
stigma of . . . syphilis, a charge utterly without justification, medically,
scientifically, individually, or socially." But Huneker did not really
agree with Gould - or perhaps he changed his mind. "You don't suppose
that I would be allowed to print the truth about Nietzsche!!!" he
remarked in a letter to Benjamin De Casseres on 21 March 1904, after
his first study of the philosopher had been reprinted. And in an
unpublished letter dated 12 June 1914, Huneker told his friend John
Quinn, the art patron, that the Nietzsche case was "a classic one.
