How to feed your plants
You will need:
* Fertiliser: granular, liquid, powder, or organic manure 
* Watering can (for liquid application) 
* Spade or fork (for digging in manure) 
Overview
Plants are able to make their own food by capturing the energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar. But in order to stay healthy and give the best results they take additional nutrients out of the soil or compost, so it's important to provide them with supplementary fertiliser. The basic nutrients required by plants are nitrogen (N) for leaf and stem growth, phosphorus (P) for root growth and potassium (K) for flowers, fruit and to maintain healthy growth. 
* Do it:
March - August
* Takes just:
20 minutes
How to do it
1. Well-rotted horse and cattle manure contains plenty of nutrients for plants. It can be added before planting or used as a surface mulch around established plants.
2. Adding fertiliser to the base of planting holes for new plants will encourage good root establishment and growth in the first season. 
3. Balanced granular fertiliser can be applied around all established plants in spring. Distribute it around the base of plants at the rate recommended on the packaging. Avoid getting granules on soft stems and leaves as it may scorch them.
4. Slow-release granules or pellets can be mixed with the compost in pots when planting summer bedding to provide nutrients for the whole growing season.
5. Fertilisers are also available to mix up with water for liquid application. Liquid concentrates and ready-to-use liquid feeds are also available. These are quick acting as the plant roots can take in the dissolved nutrients with the water. 
6. Recycle the nutrients that you apply to your garden by composting leafy prunings, dead flowers, vegetables peelings and any other suitable material. 
Adam's tip

"For best results apply fertilisers when the soil is moist."
"Apply high-potash fertilisers to encourage flowering of all plants and a good crop of any plant grown for its fruit."
"Diluted liquid feeds or fertilisers can be applied to the foliage of many plants for quick results. Always check packaging for details."
How to make a stag beetle bucket

You will need
* Bucket 
* Bark chippings 
* Soil 
* Craft knife

* Glossary A-Z 
 

You will need:
* Bucket 
* Bark chippings 
* Soil 
* Craft knife 
Overview
Stag beetles lay eggs underground near rotting wood. Their larvae live in the wood for up to five years, before pupating to become adults. Help protect this endangered species by making a simple habitat for them.
* Do it:
all year round
* Takes just:
1 hour
How to do it
1. Use a craft knife to make holes about 3 cm across in the sides and base of the bucket.
2. Choose an area of your garden that will not be disturbed and dig a hole to bury the bucket so that its rim is just below soil level. Loosely fill any gaps around the bucket with soil. 
3. Place a few large stones in the bottom of the bucket and then fill it with bark chippings and a little garden soil. 
Adam's tip

"Over time, the contents of the bucket will rot down, so top it up with fresh bark chippings periodically."
How to build a compost bin
Overview
You can't beat the satisfaction of turning kitchen and garden waste, into rich, crumbly compost that will make your plants and crops thrive. So keep your plants - and your local landfill site - happy and make your own compost bin. 
* Do it:
all year round
How to do it
1. Clear the area where you're going to put the compost bin and, if necessary, level the ground using a spade or a rake. 
2. Take a pallet and stand it on its long edge to form the back edge of the compost bin. Push a stake through the two layers of the pallet at either end, using a sledgehammer to drive them firmly into the ground - about 20-30cm deep. 
3. Position the remaining two pallets at right angles to the first to make the sides, butting the corners tightly together to stop compost spilling through the gaps. Fix in place with stakes in each corner, as in step 2.
4. To keep the structure stable, wire the pallets together at each corner. Trim the tops of the stakes with a bow saw.
5. Wire the last pallet onto the front of the right side pallet to make a gate - you'll need to open it when you want to get to the compost - and start filling your bin with garden and kitchen waste. 
Adam's tip

"Do add annual weeds to your compost bin, but avoid putting in any perennials such as couch grass or ground elder."
"Cover your bin with carpet to keep it warm and to help speed up the composting process."
How to build a raised bed
You will need

Hardcore: 850kg bag granular sub base MOT Type 1, 850kg bag sand, 25kg bag cement, breeze blocks 440x215x100mm, wacker plate, cement mixer, shovel, wheelbarrow, rake, string, wooden pegs, pole, pointing and rendering trowels, bolster chisel, rubber mallet, hawk, spirit level, hammer, sponge, washing-up liquid, line-marking spray paint, masonry paint and brush, loam topsoil
Overview

Transform a dull corner of your garden into an attractive feature with this easy-to-build, stylish raised bed. Taking just a couple of weekends to complete this project, you'll soon be enjoying the benefits of gardening, without backpain too. 
* Do it:
all year round
* Takes just:
2 weekends

How to do it
1. Clear and level the site for your raised bed, then spread a layer of hardcore. Make sure it's about 8cm deep over the entire area. 
2. Compact the hardcore using a wacker plate. This machine will flatten and level the hardcore, ensuring the footings for the bed are more secure. 
3. Using the line-marking spray paint, mark out the shape of the bed. For straight lines, tie a piece of string to two wooden pegs, secure the pegs in the ground, pulling the string taut, then spray along the string. For curves, tie a piece of string to a pole, pushing it into the ground at an equal distance between each end of the curve. Pull the string taut and mark where it meets one end of the curve. Walk the curve, keeping the string pulled tight, and spray. Leave the pole and marked string in place. 
4. Make a mortar mix - five parts building sand to one part cement. Starting with the sprayed straight edges, lay the first course of blocks, placing them on their longest end, on a bed of mortar 5cm deep. Run a length of string between two pegs to help keep the blocks in a straight line. Check the blocks are level with a spirit level. Lay the second course of blocks, staggering the joins, using a 2cm deep bed of mortar. Use a hammer and bolster chisel to cut blocks in half for the ends. Check the levels again.
5. Lay concrete blocks, short end down, on a 5cm bed of mortar to make the curved edges - this is the same height as two courses of blocks. Check curved line match up to the mark on the string tied to the pole. Lay the ends of the curved edges first, working towards the centre.
6. Carefully slot in the last block, cutting it to size if necessary. Make sure all edges of the bed are level on the vertical and horizontal, and tap them straight with a rubber mallet if necessary. Leave the whole thing to set overnight.
7. Make a render mix of five parts sand to one part cement, adding a dash of washing-up liquid to make it easier to apply. Using a rendering trowel and hawk, juggle the mixture like a pat of butter between the two tools until you get a really smooth consistency, then apply the first coat of render to the blocks. This should be 5mm - 10mm deep, and don't worry if it's quite crude. Only render halfway down the inside of the bed, as the soil will cover the rest. Once you've finished, score large diamond patterns into the surface using the corner of your trowel. This scratch coat will set overnight, then you can apply another, smoother coat on top.
8. Apply a second coat of render. Before it sets completely, gently rub it with a piece of foam or sponge. This will smooth out any imperfections, giving a consistent finish over the whole surface. 
9. Leave the bed for at least a week, then finish with masonry paint. It's essential to leave it this longs as the firmer the render gets, the stronger the structure will be. Once the paint is dry, fill the bed with topsoil, stamping it down as you go. Then it's time to get planting.
Adam's tip

"It's well worth hiring a cement mixer for this job, particularly if you're building a large bed. Most hire shops will rent them out inexpensively."

Scale insects
Tiny sap-sucking scale insects. They are 1-6mm long, and their whitish, grey-brown shells are covered by protective, waxy scales. The insects don't cause too much damage unless they are present in huge numbers, but some excrete an unsightly, sticky, sugary substance (called honeydew) which encourages the growth of a fungus called sooty mould. Early summer is the best time to tackle the problem, when the newly hatched insects are crawling around looking for a place to feed and settle.
Solution
Organic
First try to remove them with your thumbnail. If there are too many, use an insecticidal soap spray. Alternatively, leave them for the birds to pick off. In a greenhouse, use the parasitic wasp, Metaphycus helvolus, bought by mail order as a biological control.
Chemical
Use an insecticide containing imidacloprid or thiacloprid in early summer when the insects are more vulnerable.
