TG of MN500HS was carried out following the temperature profile: 20–800 °C at a heating rate of 0.5 K min?1 and isothermal heating at 400 °C and 800°C for 1 h. The TG curve for MN500HS showed a 19% loss of weight between approximately 200 and 400 °C. At a temperature close to approximately 400 °C, rapid thermal decomposition of the MN500HS resin started to occur with another 12% loss of weight between 400 and 450 °C. Increase of the temperature beyond 450 °C resulted in a further steady loss in weight with a final yield of 60%. This yield value for MN500HS was higher than that for the XAD4HS resin. 
Pyrolysis of MN500HS was carried out to investigate the influence of sulphonic groups on the thermal stability of the resin during the carbonisation process. Such an event would enable opening of the three-dimensional structure of the polymer which may result in this structure being retained in the final carbon. 
Thermal treatments of MN500HS at discrete heat treatment temperatures (HTT) 350 °C, 400 °C and 800 °C were carried out and sulphur elemental analysis of the samples is reported in Table 4. 
Table 4. 
Thermal stability and elemental analysis date for furnace treated samples 
Pyrolysis of MN500HS showed that at a temperature close to approximately 300 °C, rapid thermal decomposition of the resin started to occur resulting in a 34% loss of weight between 200 and 350 °C. Increase of the temperature beyond 400 °C resulted in a further loss of weight with a final yield of around 55 wt.%. Carbonisation of non-sulphonated styrene divinylbenzene polymer resulted in a significant weight loss (around 90%) as reported by Matsuda and Funabashi [17]. 
The sulphur present within the resin changed into SO2 gas around 300 °C (the furnace off-gases were passed through a mass spectrometer). However, around 37 wt.% of the original sulphur present in the resin remained in the residue at 350 °C (sample designated as MN500HS-HT350) and 15 wt.% of the original after a HTT of 800 °C. 
Sulphonation of the hypercrosslinked sulphonated St-DVB copolymer followed by carbonisation yields a significantly higher weight yield of the final carbon. By comparison, the unfunctionalised hypercrosslinked St-DVB resin yielded a char that corresponded to less than 10% of the original polymer weight. 
Carbonisation of the sulphonated polymer results in retention of the bi-modal pore structure (micro- and mesoporosity) in the final mesoporous carbon MN500HS-C1 (see Fig. 3). This is also reflected in the high carbon yield (lower weight loss) for the pyrolysed sulphonated polymer as discussed above. Carbonisation of MN500HS results in a moderate increase in the measured BET surface area value for the sample MN500HS-C1. The DFT surface area attributed to pores greater than 20 Å remains unchanged at 12 m2 g?1 however, in the carbon MN500HS-C1, most of the contribution comes from pores >200 Å.

The valency of the sulphur in the thermally treated polymer samples discussed above was investigated using XPS. This was done to elucidate how the sulphonic acid groups of the original polymer stabilise the structure so that the final carbon retains the pore structure of the polymer resin. 
The change in the sulphur chemistry may be monitored by S2p XPS spectra (Fig. 4a and b show the spectra). Although the total sulphur content of the surface decreases as the HTT increases, differences in sulphur valency were observed at different HTTs.

For the polymer sample (MN500HS) before pyrolysis, the binding energy of the sulphur 2p peak was 168.8 eV, which equaled the value for benzene sulphonic acid (C6H5SO3H) analysed as a reference. A new peak at 164.1 eV, was detected in the spectra after pyrolysis at 350 °C (see Fig. 4a). This was similar to the value of 164.0 eV for phenyl sulphide polymer, (C6H5S)n. The spectra for MN500HS-HTT350 also contained a small peak at a similar binding energy to the original S species. A hypothesised structural transition is shown in Fig. 5. Diphenyl sulphone (C6H5)2SO2, was also analysed as a reference for the intermediate species. However, this reference material gave a very similar binding energy to benzene sulphonic acid (168.7 eV) and therefore, the intermediate species was not identified although, this may be a likely step in the cascade of transformations occurring during the pyrolysis process. Fig. 4c suggests that at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C significant reduction of the original sulphonic acid groups is evident whereas at 800 °C the peak corresponding to sulphonic acid disappears altogether (see Fig. 4d).

Apart form the sulphur 2p spectra, surface compositional data for the samples was also obtained from XPS (see Table 5). Sulphur composition present on the external surface of the beads follows a similar trend to that obtained for the bulk sulphur elemental data discussed earlier (see Table 4). However, XPS surface data showed a reduction in sulphur content from 4 at.% down to around 1 at.% as the polymer sample was heated to 400 °C. 
Table 5. 
Surface composition of MN500HS during pyrolysis (obtained from XPS measurements) 
The S2p spectra show no oxidised sulphur at 400 °C (around 1 at.% is the limit of detection of the instrument) and higher but oxygen is still present in MN500HS-HTT400 and MN500HS-C1. This residual surface oxygen may be attributed to surface oxidation of the carbon upon exposure to the atmosphere when the samples are removed from the furnace. Within the furnace, the samples are in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. 
Sulphonated XAD4HS resin (H+ capacity, 3.4 mmol g?1) and the resulting carbon XAD4HS-C1 have a distinctive mesoporous pore structure (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). A significant proportion of surface area within the resin XAD4-HS may be attributed to mesopores in the 20–200 Å range (DFT surface area contribution by pores in this size range for XAD4HS is around 118 m2 g?1 whereas for XAD4HS-C1 it is 56 m2 g?1). The pore structure of XAD4HS-C1 mimics that of the polymer precursor albeit the total BET surface area value has reduced from 406 m2 g?1 to around 235 m2 g?1. 
Activation of MN500HS-C1 using carbon dioxide as the activating agent results in progressive increase in burn-off and hence reduction in the yield of the final char (see Table 2). Activation of MN500HS-C1at 800 °C for 0.5 h resulted in a carbon yield of 53% whereas if the activation time were increased to 5 h, the yield of carbon fell to 44% for the MN500HS-C1-A4 sample. Increasing the activation temperature had a significant impact on the degree of burn-off with MN500HS-C1-A6 sample yielding a char corresponding to 30% of the original starting polymer weight. Surface area values measured for the activated MN500HS samples shows an increase with burn-off degree. MN500HS-C1-A1 displays a BET surface area of 515 m2 g?1 compared with 1182 m2 g?1 measured for MN500HS-C1-A6. 
The effect of activation on the mechanical strength of the resulting MN500HS carbons is demonstrated by the single bead crush tests; results are reported in Fig. 6. MN500HS-C1 shows the highest mechanical strength value (1.7 kg force). Upon activation, the activated carbon samples show a reduction in mechanical strength although, the difference in mechanical strength values for samples A1–A5 are not significantly different (the BET surface area values increase over the range of carbons from 515 m2 g?1 for A1 to 782 m2 g?1 for A5). The yield of carbons fell from around 53 wt.% for A1 to around 40 wt.% for A5. The activated carbon MN500HS-C1-A6 sample shows a sudden drop in mechanical strength as the BET surface area value approached 1200 m2 g?1. The yield of the carbon was around 30 wt.%. These results suggest that mechanically robust activated carbons with BET surface area values in the range 800 m2 g?1 may be prepared using MacronetTM resins and should be tested for adsorption of middle molecules.

Carbonisation of CT275 under similar conditions to those used for MN500HS-C1 resulted in a 45 wt.% yield of residual carbon displaying a BET surface area value of 473 m2 g?1. Activation of CT275 at 850 °C for 3 h resulted in a significantly higher degree of burn-off in comparison with MN500HS and a final char corresponding to a carbon yield of around 20 wt.% or lower was obtained. Under similar activation conditions, carbons prepared from hypersol crosslinked MacronetTM resins display higher yield values. They are thermally more stable than active carbons prepared from conventional styrene divinylbenzene resins e.g. XAD4 and CT275. 
It was thought that the concentration of sulphonic groups within the polymeric resin may influence the thermal stability of the polymer during the pyrolysis stage. Hence, increasing the concentration of sulphonic groups in the styrene divinylbenzene resins may increase the yield of the resulting carbons. Carbonisation and subsequent activation of CT275 yields 45 wt.% and 23 wt.%, respectively of CT275-C1 and CT275-C1-A1. CT275 contained 5.9 mmol g?1 of sulphonic groups in comparison with 4.7 mmol g?1 of sulphonic groups present in MN500HS. Hence, the slightly higher concentration of sulphonic groups in CT275 did not have a measurable impact upon the yield of the carbon. The higher degree of crosslinking in MN500HS may play a more important role in the subsequent yield of the carbon upon polymer pyrolysis. 
CT275-C1 appears to be mechanically more robust in comparison with other carbons evaluated during the current study. CT275-C1 and MN500HS-C1 both show similar BET surface area values (473 m2 g?1) as well as contribution to surface area by mesopores (16 and 12 m2 g?1, respectively). The highly activated carbon sample CT275-C1-A1 showed a significant drop in bead mechanical strength from 2.6 kg force to 0.5 kg force (see Table 2). This result is in-line with what is expected i.e. high degree of surface activation results in lowering of the mechanical strength of the carbons. Carbon activation with carbon dioxide as the oxidising gas results in gasification of the material and a highly developed pore structure builds-up inside them. After the pyrolysis and carbonisation step, pores of the unactivated carbon beads are often filled with tar decomposition products and are blocked with amorphous carbon. During activation, this amorphous carbon is burnt away. Slight widening of micropores due to burning off of the neighbouring walls is also observed. This results in a decrease in the mechanical strength of the resulting material. 
Activation of MN500HS-C1 at different temperatures e.g. 800 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C results in a marked reduction in the yield of the final carbon from 46% for MN500HS-C1-A3 down to around 30% for MN500HS-C1-A6 (see Table 2). Carbon activation is a complex heterogeneous process that encompasses transport of the activating agent to the surface within particles, reaction with the surface, desorption of the reaction products and diffusion of these products from to the particle surface. The concentration profile of carbon dioxide within the bead volume and hence the formation of the pore structure depends on the rates of the particular reaction steps. However, activation temperature has a marked effect on the carbon activation process. At low temperatures, the rate of reaction of the carbon surface with the activating agent is small, so it is this reaction that limits the overall rate of the process. This results in a dynamic equilibrium becoming established between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the pores and that in the intraparticle spaces. With increase of the activation temperature, the rate of the chemical reactions occurring during the activation process increase much faster than the diffusion of carbon dioxide; in such a case, the overall rate of the process becomes limited by the rate of transport of the activating agent into the granule.
