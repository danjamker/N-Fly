The World Conquering Jeff Stelling's Super Special Soccer Saturday Drinking Game

While recent STT coverage has waxed lyrical about the untapped potential of combining football with naked women, this game aims to remove any chance of seeing the latter by fueling the excitement of Saturday afternoon results with an incapacitating amount of alcohol. 
So much is right about this game that it is a miracle that it hasn't been rushed through the bureaucratic quagmire of the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in our 2012 event. 
Below are a complete set of the rules but obviously they are all open to interpretation and substitution. Actually following this playbook word for word (i.e. a shot of beer for ever single goal scored on a Saturday) will almost certainly result in hospitalisation but if you're man enough to do it, we're man enough to put up pictures of you being sick on yourself! 
Please note that the STT editorial staff shall be attempting this mammoth challenge in early February and the results shall be duly presented for all to see then…
You will need:
- a lined stomach
- twice your combined bodyweight in beer

- a bottle of Jagermeister
- a bottle of indiscriminate other spirit
- a bin / plastic bag / bucket to be sick into
- an understanding girlfriend
- a desire to remember nothing that happened on Saturday at all
- a willingness to lose teeth / end up in hospital once a week

- Whenever Dundee appear on the vidiprinter, the last person to shout out “Football!” takes shot of Jager

- Every time Brighton &amp; Hove, or Daggenham &amp; Redbridge are jokingly referred to as being two different teams playing the same opposition = 1 shot of Jager
- Every time anything bad happens to Craig Bellamy, Lee Bowyer or Joey Barton (injury, own goal, booked, sent off, arrested for murder etc) = 2 celebratory shots of the spirit of your choice

- Any hint of racism (casual or otherwise) from any of the pundits = Quad bombs (4 Jager shots + a redbull) all round
- Every time Jeff makes an “a Trialist” joke you must do 3 shots of beer
- Every time Jeff calls Kenny Deucher “The Good Doctor” = 1 shot of spirit
- Every time Jeff says “its Doom and Gloom at...” = 1 shot of Jager
- Every time Arbroath striker Kevin Webster scores and Jeff says “ohh, Sally will be pleased” = 1 shot of Jager

- “That's the magic of the cup”
- “Potential banana skin”
- “Who said the FA cup was dead?”
- “Giant killing”
- “And he's a PLASTERER / PLUMBER / ELECTRICIAN etc by trade…”
- “They'll be dancing in the streets of (Total Network Solutions etc) tonight!”
PRACTICE VIDEO
You can practice what you have larnt on this classic video, where Chris Kamara presents the eleven goal thriller between Portsmouth and Reading earlier this season:



I counted at least two 'unbelievables' there, as well as 2 goals over the 5 goal limit. That's at least 2 shots and 2 downed drinks to begin with, as well as supping constantly the 7 or 8 minutes that Kammy's in frame. Enjoy!

Just how good were the likes of Maradona at Napoli and the great AC Milan team?
Benj Stallard, via e-mail
These were the two dominating clubs at the time I played in Italy. Particularly Milan was by far the best team. In the middle of the 80s, beginning of the 90s they were nearly unbeatable, even though Napoli still won two titles. Milan played football from out of this world at that time. Napoli was very dependent on Diego Maradona. Overall it was a great time for me.
Your team-mate Jurgen Klinsmann was famous for diving (at least in England, he was), but it was you who won the decisive penalty in the 1990 World Cup Final and replays suggest you fell easily. Was it a dive?
Rob Hughes, Leicester
I usually get out of it by saying that you have referees that would have awarded the penalty and referees that don't. He awarded it, but he didn't have to. But I think that he blowed the whistle because there were two or three situations earlier where he decided wrongfully against us. It was the amount of tacklings and jostles before that led to his decision. But I tell you honestly: If he had not awarded the penalty, there wouldn't had been great complaints from our side. The Argentinians were upset, of course. But I think that they can't complain because they were not penalised in various situations before. I felt a certain justle in the box as the Argentinian attacked me, but it wasn't a big thing. But that's football.
Horst Tappert is the only German actor who has achieved fame abroad and I used to watch the long-running detective series Derrick - are you a fan?
Steve Morgan, Kingston
I can tell you frankly: No. I like to watch detective series, but Derrick is not one of my favourites. I know that he is extremely popular all around the world - in Italy and Japan for example he is a hero, but not quite my thing. 
Did Jurgen Klinsmann ask for your advice before taking over as Germany coach? If so, what did you tell him?
Ross, Plymouth
Yes, before his first match as national coach he visited me at home. We sat together a couple of hours and talked about certain procedures which I got to know during my four years in this position. I knew about the responsability of this job and told him about it, so that he could get an idea of it. But we did not talk about tactical things, the issues were procedures before and after the matches and so on.
Which league do you think is the strongest in Europe at the moment?
Neil Smith, Epsom
No doubt about it: the English Premier League. At least the first four teams are a class of its own. After them, the quality gets a little bit lower, just as in all the other leagues, but globally speaking, England has the strongest league at the moment.
They say you should never go back. Did your heart rule your head when you went back to coach Roma briefly in 2004? What kind of situation did you walk into?
Trevor O'Neill via e-mail
Exactly, this was a big mistake of mine. I just resigned as national coach after the EURO 2004 and actually wanted to take a break for half a year or one year. But AS Roma and Bayer Leverkusen were the only two clubs in the world which I would have accepted in this moment. Then I received the call from Rome with the offer, and it was a straight heart decision. In hindsight, it was not a good idea and a 
mistake.
What issue in football today most urgently needs addressing, why, and what can initiatives like 'feel football' to do solve issues like this?
Marc Hudson, Pontefract
The closeness between the fans and the professional players is a very important thing. That´s why I like the "feel football" campaign so much. It creates a dialogue between the two parties. Football has become more open and visible through television and all the press in the last decades, but certain things remain very distant, and we should go about these issues. A lot of people are concerned about improving things in professional football, even though some suggestions are not that helpful. And one should think critically about this and introduce some changes because in the end it is our audience that goes to the stadiums and sits in front of the TVs. If they have good ideas, why not realize them?
