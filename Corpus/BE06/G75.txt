A week later the first executions took place at Salem, generating scepticism on both sides of the Atlantic.159 A woman who pleaded guilty to bewitching cattle at Canterbury in 1703 was convicted merely of intent.160 The trial of Jane Wenham in 1712 and another at Leicester in 1717 set the seal on judicial policy.161 In the latter case the accused was discharged despite evidence of the water ordeal, searching, bodily teats, shape-shifting, women voiding stones, and bees streaming from victims' mouths — all supported by twenty-five witnesses.162 This marked the final phase in the legal reality of witchcraft. Under Elizabeth I evidence had been intangible but credible; with the Stuarts it became incredible; and in the mid seventeenth century it was tangible, indeed fantastic, and credible. By 1700, however, it was both tangible and incredible — a shift marked by Lord Chief Justice Sir Matthew Hale's replacement by the sceptical Sir John Holt. Hale, who hanged three women in 1662, believed witches to be ‘within reach of human justice and government', the same belief that had inspired Hopkins and Stearne to find better evidence for more demanding times. Shortly before his death in 1676 Hale had a change of heart, reflecting that witchcraft was, after all, a ‘secret thing' known only to God.163

Hugh Trevor-Roper's assertion that ‘to the last the most radical argument against the witch-craze was not that witches do not exist but simply that the judges err in their identification' is borne out by the English example.164 The broader causes and intellectual implications of this, however, deserve greater attention than they have received. The Scientific Revolution influenced the decline of witch-trials less than is sometimes imagined, not least because few historians of science regard this gradual, branched and ambiguous process as a revolution at all.165 And yet more subtle, indirect connections between witchcraft and science can be traced within fluid contexts of debate in law and philosophy. Declining convictions for witchcraft marked a fundamental shift in the social construction of justice, a process inextricably linked to evolving conceptions of physical and spiritual worlds after 1660. This, in turn, fed into changing ideas about truth and the language by which it was constituted. Boundaries between the probable and the certain, the provable and the unknowable, were being redrawn in a way that prompts a reinterpretation of the East Anglian witch-trials of 1645–7. 
Reliance on hearsay declined. In the 1580s George Gifford dismissed ‘rumors and likelihoods' as proofs; but punishing witchcraft depended on such trivia.166 Elizabethan jurists looked to classical models for guidance: the Kentish JP William Lambarde followed Cicero for his handbook, Eirenarcha, published in 1581.167 In the same Roman tradition, the professor of civil law at Cambridge in 1607 defined evidence as ‘Indices or tokens' spoken by witnesses at a trial; but increasingly these were understood as causes of suspicion upon which to commit but not convict.168 A comparison with slander is instructive. In the reign of James I, to be called a witch became actionable only if a specific felony was alleged which the accuser then declined to prove at law; in other words, the substantive power of hearsay had disappeared.169 In 1618 Michael Dalton's Countrey Justice modernized Lambarde's Eirenarcha as a practical guide to evidence, including three strengths of presumption outlined by Sir Edward Coke: violent, probable and light. ‘Probable certainty' pointed towards things that were demonstrable and likely but not true beyond question.170 In the 1620s Sir Francis Bacon established a series of logical principles based on reason in nature, advising juries to find truth in proofs accordingly.171 Judges, too, were instructed to derive learning and reason from logic and nature as well as from the Bible.172 By mid century the idea was well established that evidence, originating from witnesses or documents, had become the means for a jury and judge ‘to determine matter of fact'.173 
The relationship between judge and juror was crucial. The medieval evolution of juries into tribunals had increased their dependence upon testimony for determining truth; even more than that, as John Baker has argued, ‘the decision as to what were material questions of fact for the jury necessitated a decision as to what the law was'.174 Coherent laws of evidence and proof did not emerge until the eighteenth century, but their core principles were shaped decades earlier.175 Law reforms in the Interregnum further increased the independence of juries as arbiters of truth, and in 1670 Chief Justice Sir John Vaughan ruled that ‘judges do not respond to questions of fact, jurors do not respond to questions of law', separating their roles but also obliging the former to help the latter pass reasonable verdicts.176 Another landmark ruling came in 1684 when hearsay, a dubious form of proof for a generation, was banished from most trials.177 After 1689 judges paid an increasing amount of attention to rules of evidence and so helped to extend and refine a corpus of knowledge which marginalized unreliable testimony, and sought to assess the remainder along more empirical lines.178 Changing standards here had made witchcraft much harder to prove by 1700; conversely when cases did arise they exposed more general evidential problems.179 
Religion was also relevant to legal change, as cause and effect, because the spiritual comportment of Christians and the decision-making of jurors relied on conscience. William Perkins's casuistry had propounded ‘moral certainty', a concept of truths rooted in inner conviction that echoed through the work of Coke, and which a century later John Locke modified as three types of compelling probability based on personal experience, reliable testimony and common knowledge.180 At first, this common-sense, liberal Anglican view, which also owed much to the fair-minded cleric William Chillingworth in the 1630s, inhibited both dogmatism and scepticism; doubts about the absolute certainty of religious truths also undermined certitude that particular ideas were false. The cause of toleration was well served by this reasoning, but in the end awe for the mysteries of the unseen world was not.181 After 1660 the quest for truth about witchcraft set off in both directions. Joseph Glanvill was a Restoration Anglican influenced by Chillingworth, and yet he — like Richard Baxter and Henry More — compiled stories about the spirit world to disprove detested Hobbesian materialism by empirical means.182 An opposing interpretation would prevail, namely that this demonology relied too much on trust in ancient wisdom and too little on sense, experience and ‘very plain mere observation'.183 According to the physician John Webster, witchmongers like Glanvill had ‘from one to another lickt up the Vomit of the first Broacher of this vain and false opinion'.184 The heavenly scheme itself was endangered by such thinking. Locke noted many reasons to believe in spirits, not least divine revelation, ‘but our Senses not being able to discover them, we want the means of knowing their particular Existences'.185 
Defending religion demanded constant reappraisal of the frontiers between the sacred and the profane, the cosmic and the temporal. The quest for truth in law and religion, therefore, was inseparable from scientific endeavour and ‘a new faith in the potentialities of human initiative'.186 Anglican writers emphasized natural aspects of preternatural events to frustrate the devil's deceptions and to delineate God's agency more clearly. The path to understanding providence was not reverence for omens and wonders, but rational thought and trust in conscience.187 In 1663 theologian John Spencer judged prodigies to be mere ‘Anomalies of Nature', arguing that superstition and enthusiasm alike ‘wast[e]th the faculty of Reason' by laying claim to divine discoveries and propagating error through fear — as Satan intended.188 Attributing illness to witchcraft fell into the same category. The reification of the spirit world inspired wonder but also exposed it to scrutiny from which its phenomena might be redefined as mundane. Like the law, science relied on conviction and testimony, and was profoundly influenced by legal language and principles.189 In 1681 Robert Boyle argued that the purpose of reason was ‘to close with discovered Truths' using evidence, and drew parallels between the ideal judge and the ideal scientist: both were open-minded and objective observers.190 By 1700 moral certainty, whether for the assize judge, natural philosopher or Anglican divine, relied on data divided into what Lorraine Daston has termed ‘the internal evidence of things and the external evidence of testimony'.191 Thus witchcraft ceased to be ‘within reach of human justice and government', as Lord Chief Justice Hale had believed, and became an unsupported assumption that could never be demonstrated as fact.192 
The careers of Matthew Hopkins and John Stearne are positioned halfway between the heyday of the Protestant demonologists (and the high point of witch-trials) in the 1590s and the so-called Glanvill–Webster debate (and the dregs of the executions) in the 1680s. In epistemological terms, the witchfinders were caught between two systems of reasoning: a priori, where the meaning of effects was deduced from causes established by tradition; and a posteriori, a more experimental, inductive procedure by which causes were arrived at from the accumulation of evidence. As a consequence Hopkins was doomed to end up not only a puritan derided as a papal inquisitor, but also an empiricist derided as a charlatan and mystic.193 It has been said that Hopkins's significance resides in his importing ‘continental' ideas — sabbats, diabolic pacts, and so on — into English trials, whereas in fact it lies in his application of William Perkins's demonological classifications to his own experience, made possible by the administrative chaos of the Civil War.194 The difficulty he faced was not just that peace brought more stringent controls upon legal conduct, but that as claims to diabolism had become more explicit, so the evidence on which those claims were based was more closely examined. This, in turn, helped to destabilize the whole concept of witchcraft by dividing opinion about what it was and how it might be known, thereby continuing a process which had begun with the divergence of puritan and mainstream Anglican opinion in the 1590s.195 
If the witchfinders do reflect a growing ‘continental' influence in English witch-trials, that influence surely lies in the migration of the language of presumptions and proofs into English law, a process which forced precision in the legal identification of witches and so in the end made it impossible.196 The pursuit of the confession by Hopkins and Stearne, and their willingness to investigate and to explain, is consonant with this. There is something in the idea, advanced over a century ago but little remarked upon since, that ‘Hopkins was the first to reduce the practice of witchfinding to a science and to systematise the methods in vogue'.197 Early modern demonology was, in Lyndal Roper's words, ‘to a large degree a science founded on the evidence of experience', even if rationalist and empiricist philosophers were divided over whether experience was the well-spring of truth or of false consciousness.198 Today, however, we accept not only that scientific truth and legal truth can be ‘a matter simply of politics and negotiation' dependent on witness testimony, but also that reason and conscience allow us to establish truth beyond reasonable doubt.199 
One difference between seventeenth-century law, religion and science is key. Whereas in the last two disciplines reality was being remade mostly through socially restricted contexts of contemplation and communication — private reading, university disputations, ecclesiastical convocations, and correspondence between virtuosi — changes in legal practice were played out publicly within a dynamic matrix of opinion involving learned judges, middling jurors, and ordinary plaintiffs and witnesses. It was short-sighted of Trevor-Roper to eschew ‘elementary village credulities' for the history of witchcraft, and not just because of the work of Keith Thomas, Alan Macfarlane and their social historical heirs. By refusing to accept the evidence for popular beliefs in court, judges and, in practice, jurors were exercising new ideas about the determination of truth. Furthermore, from the 1680s new standards of proof required for a range of felonies established principles that would affect more rarefied debates in religion and science in the eighteenth century. It took almost forty years after Matthew Hopkins's death for the execution of witches to end; but by bringing to the public arena of the courtroom graphic testimony of extreme apostasy and diabolic perversion, the witchfinder hastened the demise of the crime he had attacked so ferociously.
