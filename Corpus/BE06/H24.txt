3.1 In 2004-05 the planned total public expenditure for the Department of Health is £77,660 million. This includes the NHS Pensions budget of £6,191 million.
3.2 Figure 3.1 summarises the resource plans for the Department of Health for years 1998-99 to 2005-06. More detailed information is provided in Annexes A2 and A3.
3.3 This chapter provides information on the Government's expenditure plans up until 2007-08. A breakdown of the spending programme can be found in Chapter 6.
Budget 2002 Announcement
NHS 5 Year Expenditure Plans
3.4 In his 2002 Budget the Chancellor announced expenditure plans for the NHS up to 2007-08. The announcement represents an annual average increase of 7.3% in real terms between 2002-03 and 2007-08, a total increase of 42% in real terms over the period.
3.5 The expenditure plans announced by the Chancellor in his 2002 Budget are shown in Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2: England Net NHS Expenditure Plans (Stage 2 Resource Budgeting) 2002-03 to 2007-08, as announced by the Chancellor in Budget 2002 (£ billion)
3.6 Since the 2002 Budget, NHS expenditure plans have been changed and appropriate adjustments made for the following reasons:
* Pensions Indexation
From 2003-04 onwards the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) for the Department of Health has been increased by a switch from the Exchequers Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) spending to cover the increased cost of pensions. An addition of over £1.6bn has been made to the NHS DEL to cover these costs from 2003-04 onwards.
* Free Nursing Care
From 2003-04 the NHS is responsible for paying for the cost of providing Free Nursing Care to those in Nursing Homes.
* Health Care in Prisons
From 2003-04 the Department of Health is responsible for paying for the cost of providing health care in prisons. An addition of over £100m to the Department's Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) has been made to cover these costs from 2003-04 onwards.
3.7 These changes mean that NHS Expenditure figures reported in this chapter are not directly comparable across the period.
3.8 The spending plans have also been adjusted to reflect the reduction in the cost of capital charge from 6% to 3.5%. Under Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB), this reflects the opportunity and financing costs of capital; and changes to the discount rate applied to future liabilities. This adjustment has been treated as a classification change by HM Treasury. This means that the expenditure figures reported on a Stage 2 Resource Budgeting basis within this chapter, and in Annexes A2 and A3, have been adjusted for this change.
3.9 Whilst all of the changes mentioned above affect the total level of NHS expenditure they do not increase or decrease the spending power of the NHS. They are all cost neutral and are merely definitional changes.
Personal Social Services (PSS)
3.10 As part of his 2002 Budget the Chancellor also confirmed central government provision for Personal Social Services (PSS), funded by both the Department of Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, for years 2003-04 to 2005-06. These plans mean an average annual growth in resources for PSS of 6.0% in real terms over the three years. These new spending plans are set out in Figure 3.3 below.
Figure 3.3: Funding announced for PSS by the Chancellor in Budget 2002 (£ billion)
3.11 The health and social services programmes consist of:
Spending by the National Health Service on the following programmes:
NHS Hospital and Community Health Services, and Discretionary Family Health Services.
This covers hospital and community health services, prescribing costs for drugs and appliances and General Medical Services (which include reimbursements of GMS GPs' practice staff, premises, out of hours and IM&amp;T expenses). It also includes other centrally funded initiatives, services and special allocations managed centrally by the Department of Health (such as service specific levies which fund activities in the areas of education and training and research and development);
HCFHS includes all GMS funding. This is because of the introduction of the new GP contract in April 2004 which means that there is no longer any GMS non-discretionary funding. All GMS funding is now discretionary and PCTs were informed of their 2004-05 PMeds Allocation in February 2004. In order to present a consistent run of expenditure in Figure 3.4(a) and (b) GMS non-discretionary expenditure has been restated as HCFHS.
NHS Family Health Service (FHS) nondiscretionary.
This covers demand-led family health services, such as the cost of general dental and ophthalmic services, dispensing remuneration and income from dental and prescription charges;
Central Health and Miscellaneous Services (CHMS)
Providing services which are administered centrally, for example, certain public health functions and support to the voluntary sector; Administration of the Department of Health; and Expenditure on Personal Social Services by way of:
* funding provided by the Department of Health; and
* funding provided by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
National Health Service, England - by area of expenditure
3.12 Figure 3.4a shows the main areas in which funds were spent for years 1999-2000 to 2002-03 on a Stage 1 Resource Budgeting basis.
3.13 Figure 3.4b shows the main areas in which funds are spent for years 2002-03 to 2005-06 on a Stage 2 Resource Budgeting basis. Total NHS expenditure figures are consistent with those in Figure 3.1.
Expenditure in 2003-04
3.14 Figure 3.5 compares estimated outturn expenditure in 2003- 04 with planned expenditure published in last year's report.

3.15 The main areas of change (£10 million or over) to the spending plans for the various parts of the programme are shown in Figure 3.6.

NHS Expenditure Plans in 2004-05
3.16 NHS Net Expenditure in 2004-05 is planned to be £69.2 billion.
3.17 The largest part of NHS spending is on Hospital and Community Health Services, discretionary Family Health Services and related services.
3.18 For 2004-05 the planned HCFHS revenue expenditure is £62.6 billion. Net HCFHS capital expenditure is planned to be £3.3 billion. Within overall NHS net expenditure, the total for non-discretionary FHS is expected to account for £1.9 billion in 2004-05. The remainder will be spent on Central Health and Miscellaneous Services.
3.19 Figure 3.7 contains the breakdown of NHS Net Expenditure for 2004-05 (Plan).

NHS Resources
3.20 Figure 3.8 shows how NHS Resources are allocated. It shows that 81% of the total NHS budget will be controlled by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in 2004-05. Figures are consistent with those shown in Table 1 of Health Service Circular (HSC) 2002/012 announcing three-year PCT revenue allocations and HSC 2004/003, announcing Primary Medical Services Allocations for 2004-05.
3.21 They are therefore consistent with the NHS settlement announced by the Chancellor in his Budget 2002 statement. They do not take account of any subsequent changes in the expenditure plans as a result of changes set out in paragraph 3.6, such as the effect of the change in the discount rate.
Programme budget - Where the money has gone

Background
3.22 In 2002, the Department initiated the national Programme Budgeting Project. The aim of the Project is to develop a primary source of information, which can be used by all bodies, to give a greater understanding of 'where the money is going' and 'what we are getting for the money we invest' in the NHS.
3.23 The Project aims to provide an answer to these two questions by mapping all Primary Care Trust (PCT) (and Strategic Health Authority) expenditure, including that on primary care services, to programmes of care based on medical conditions. The focus on medical conditions clearly forges a closer and more obvious link between the object of expenditure and the patient care it delivers.
3.24 Analysis of expenditure in this way should help PCTs examine the health gain that can be obtained from investment; and will help inform understanding around equity and how patterns of expenditure map to the epidemiology of the local population.
3.25 Accordingly, the initiative will clarify the existing disposition of resources across programme areas. Equally important is the potential to accelerate modernisation. Comparative analysis, together with a process of challenge, offers the opportunity to identify best practice elsewhere for local application, in either its original or modified form.
Financial year 2003-04
3.26 Considerable work has been carried out in preparing for the implementation of Programme Budgeting within the NHS. This has included development work at three pilot sites during 2003 to evaluate and take forward the processes that need to be implemented. From this experience, a methodology has been developed and agreed with organisations including the National Audit Office, HM Treasury and the Audit Commission.
3.27 From the financial year 2003-04 onwards, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Strategic Health Authorities will report the totality of their expenditure on a programme basis each year. For the first time, this will provide a range of stakeholders with valuable comparative information, using a consistent framework, that:
* identifies where resources are currently invested, e.g. for the purpose of monitoring expenditure against National Service Frameworks;
* assists in evaluating the efficacy of the current pattern of resource deployment; and,
* strengthens the process for identifying the most effective way of investing in services for the future.
Background to programme budgeting
3.28 Programme Budgeting is a retrospective appraisal of resource allocation, broken down into meaningful programmes, with a view to tracking future resource allocation in those same programmes.
3.29 Programme Budgeting had its roots in the Rand Corporation in the USA in the 1950s. Its first major application was for the US Department of Defence in the 1960s where it was used as part of a cost accounting tool that could display, over time, the deployment of resources towards specific military objectives. Such objectives were looked at in terms of wars overseas, the support of NATO or the defence of the homeland, instead of the conventional 'inputs based' budgetary headings of tanks, missiles or diesel fuel. Allocation of new resources, or shifts between budgets, could be judged on their relative contribution to these specific objectives.
3.30 This approach can equally be applied to healthcare. Instead of seeing investment on the level of a hospital or drug budget, the focus switches to specific health objectives or medical conditions. The aim is to maximise health gain through deploying available resources to best effect. Clearly, this aim complements the commissioning role of PCTs.
Financial year 2002-03
3.31 In the interim, the NAO and HM Treasury requested that the Department provide a 'top down' analysis of expenditure (by programme budget category) for inclusion within Schedule 5 of the Department's 2002-03 Resource Accounts (the Department's Resource Accounts are a set of annual statutory accounts that are the subject of NAO audit.). The figures within Schedule 5 are repeated in the table below:
3.32 It is recognised that the implementation of Programme Budgeting is a process that will require refinement over a long period. In particular, figures produced in the early years will be a best estimate rather than a precise measurement of expenditure.
3.33 Within this context the Department of Health will be looking for year-on-year improvements, in both the process and outcomes of Programme Budgeting, rather than year one being absolutely right.
Regional breakdown of spend
3.34 Figure 3.10 attributes the total NHS expenditure reported in Figure 3.1 on a local government regional basis. Total resources for each year, including central expenditure, have been attributed according to NHS Annual Accounts returns. The analysis, which is new to the 2004 Departmental Report, has been included at the request of HM Treasury. It will be included in the Reports for all Departments from 2005.
