Introduction. Let K be a compact, 1-connected Lie group with complexification
G and Lie algebra k, and X a compact, connected Riemann surface. The
moduli spaceM(X) of isomorphism classes of flat K-bundles on X is homeomorphic
to the moduli space of grade-equivalence classes of semistable G-bundles,
by the theorems of Narasimhan-Seshadri and Ramanathan.
M(X) has two presentations as an infinite dimensional quotient which can
be used to study its cohomology. The first presentation was introduced by Atiyah
and Bott and is rather well understood. Let A(X) denote the affine space of
connections on the trivial K-bundle over X, with symplectic structure induced by
a choice of metric on k. The group K(X) of gauge transformations acts symplectically
on A(X) with moment map given by the curvature, and the symplectic
quotient is M(X).
Atiyah and Bott used the stratification of A(X) into Harder-Narasimhan types to compute the
Betti numbers of M(X); they conjectured that the stratification is identical to the
stratification into stable manifolds for the gradient flow of minus the Yang-Mills
functional. This was proved by Donaldson and Daskalopolous, who
also proved convergence of the gradient flow up to gauge transformation. R°ade proved that the gradient flow itself converges, and gave estimates for the
rate of convergence.
The second presentation has origins in Weil's double coset construction,
[3, p. 595]; here the related analysis has been less studied. Let S ⊂ X be an embedded
circle, and X the Riemann surface with boundary obtained by cutting X along S. The Yang-Mills heat flow on the space A(X) was studied by Donaldson, who obtained an analog of the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem: The moduli
space M(X) of flat K-bundles with framings on the boundary is diffeomorphic
to G(∂X)/Ghol(X), where G(∂X) = Map (∂X,G) and Ghol(X) denotes the subgroup
of G(∂X) consisting of loops that extend holomorphically over the interior.
The loop group K(S) acts symplectically on M(X) with moment map given by
the difference of the restriction to the two boundary components, and M(X) is
homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient.
In recent years, this presentation has become more popular because of its connection
with conformal field theory and the Verlinde formulas. Here the circle S is assumed to bound a disk, so that X (in its algebraic
manifestation) becomes a punctured curve union a formal disk. Surfaces with
boundary do not fit into the algebraic framework.
In this paper we consider the analog of the Yang-Mills heat flow in the second
presentation, namely the gradient flow of minus the square of the moment map for
the loop group for an arbitrary embedded circle S in X. We show that the analog
of R°ade's result holds: The gradient flow exists for all times and converges to a
critical point. Although the evolution equation itself is not pseudo-differential, its
restriction to the boundary is a (nonlinear) heat equation involving the Dirichletto-
Neumann operator associated to the connection. Calder´on observed that this
is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator. Because pull-back to the boundary is
Fredholm on the space of harmonic forms, we are "up to finite dimensions" in
the same situation as for the first presentation, except that the moduli space of
framed bundles is not affine.
This analysis implies that M(X) admits a stratification into stable manifolds
for minus the gradient flow, which can be viewed as a generalization of the
Birkhoff decomposition to surfaces of higher genus. By definition, the stable
manifold for the zero locus of the moment map is the semistable locus. The other
strata are complex submanifolds of finite codimension, and the number of strata
of each codimension is finite. Using the stratification, we obtain several cohomological
applications which extend known results beyond the case that S bounds a
disk. The first, which was the motivation for the paper, is a K¨ahler "quantization
commutes with reduction" theorem, similar to that of Guillemin-Sternberg in
the finite dimensional case. This is an instance of Segal's composition axiom for
the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. In the case S bounds
a disk, the algebraic version is due to Beauville-Laszlo, Kumar-Narasimhan-
Ramanathan, and Laszlo-Sorger; see also Teleman. The second
application is a surjectivity result for the equivariant cohomology with rational
coefficients, similar to that of Kirwan. In the case that S bounds a disk an
essentially equivalent result was proved by Bott, Tolman, and Weitsman. An
appendix contains a review of the relevant Sobolev spaces.
Background on connections on a circle. The following is contained in
Pressley-Segal in the context of smooth maps. Let S be a circle, that is, a
connected one-manifold.
For any s &gt; 0, the group K(S)s+12:= Map (S,K)s+12 of free loops of Sobolev class s + 12
acts on the space A(S)s−12 of connections on the trivial bundle S ×K. Any connection differs from the trivial connection by a k-valued one-form; using the trivial connection as a base point we identify A(S)s−12 → Ω1(S; k)s−12.
For any s &gt; r &gt; 0 inclusion defines a bijection K(S)r−12\A(S)r+12→ K(S)s−12\A(S)s+12.
For s &gt; 2, there is a smooth holonomy map Hol: A(S)s−12→ K depending on the choice of base point x0 in S; the assumption s &gt; 2 implies that A is C1 which guarantees existence of a solution to the parallel transport equation.
For s &gt; 0 and A ∈ A(S)s−12 the stabilizer K(S)s+12, A is a compact, connected Lie
group. For s &gt; 2, K(S)s+12,A is isomorphic to the centralizer of the holonomy
Hol (A) via the map K(S)s+12 → K, k → k(x0).
Let Kx0 (S)s+12 denote the space of k ∈ K(S)s+12 such that k(x0) is the identity. For
s &gt; 0 there are bijections Kx0 (S)s+12\A(S)s−12 → K, K(S)s+12\A(S)s−12 → Ad (K)\K,
which for s &gt; 2 are given by taking the holonomy, resp. conjugacy class of the
holonomy of the connection.
The orbits of K(S)s+12 on A(S)s−12 can be parametrized by the Weyl alcove
as follows. Let Λ denote the coweight lattice of T and Waff := W  Λ
the affine Weyl group. The action of Waff on the Cartan subalgebra t has fundamental domain.
Background on connections on a surface. Let X be a compact, connected,
oriented surface. Since K is simply-connected, any principal K-bundle
is isomorphic to the trivial bundle X × K. Let A(X)s denote the affine space of
connections on X × K of Sobolev class s &gt; 0. Using the trivial connection as
base point we may identify A(X)s → Ω1(X; k)s.
For any A ∈ A(X)s and K-representation V, we have by the Sobolev multiplication
theorem a covariant derivative dA(V): Ω0(X; V)s+1 → Ω1(X; V)s → Ω2(X; V)s−1.
Let dA := dA(k) denote the covariant derivative for the adjoint representation. A
is flat if and only if d2 A = 0. Choose a Riemannian metric on X and invariant
metric ( , ) on k and let ∗X: Ω•(X; k) → Ω2−•(X; k) denote the resulting Hodge star operator. The operator dA|Ω0(X, ∂X; k)s+1 has L2 adjoint d∗A: Ω1(X; k)−s → Ω0(X; k)−s−1, α 	→ ∗X dA ∗ Xα
which restricts to a map Ω1(X; k)s → Ω0(X; k)s−1.
LEMMA 3.0.1. Suppose ∂X is nonempty. For A ∈ A(X)s, s &gt; 0, (a) The generalized Laplacian
d∗A dA: Ω0(X, ∂X; k)s+1 → Ω0(X; k)s−1 is an isomorphism.
Proof. (a) Let A ∈ A(X) be smooth. By elliptic regularity Ker ( d∗
A dA)
consists of smooth solutions, see [16, Chapter 20], and we have a Hodge decomposition
Ω0(X; k)s−1 = Im(d∗A dA) ⊕ Ker ( d∗A dA). By the Aronszajn-Cordes
uniqueness theorem [1], Ker ( d∗A dA) = 0 and so d∗A dA is an isomorphism. Since
A(X) is dense in A(X)s and dA depends continuously on A ∈ A(X)s, d∗
A dA is an isomorphism for any A ∈ A(X)s. (b) By part (a), the subspaces are disjoint.
For a ∈ Ω0(X; k)s, we may find ξ ∈ Ω0(X, ∂X; k)s+1 such that d∗Aa = d∗
A dAξ. Then a − dAξ ∈ ker d∗A which shows the first splitting; the second is similar. (c)
follows immediately from d2A = (d∗A)2 = 0.
For s &gt; 0 the gauge group K(X)s+1 := Map (X,K)s+1 is a Banach Lie group and acts on A(X)s by the formula k · A = Ad(k)A + k d(k−1) = Ad (k)A − dk k−1 in any faithful matrix representation of K. It has Lie algebra k(X)s+1 := Ω0(X; k)s+1.
The generating vector fields for the action of K(X)s+1 on A(X)s are
ξA(X)(A) := ddt ( exp ( − tξ) · A)|t=0 = dAξ, ξ ∈ k(X)s+1. 
In particular, the Lie algebra k(X)A of the stabilizer K(X)A of A is
k(X)A = ker ( dA | Ω0(X; k)).
Suppose X is equipped with a complex structure. The map d + ad(A) → ∂α := ∂ + ad(α) where α is the (0, 1)-form corresponding to a, defines a one-to-one correspondence
between covariant derivatives and holomorphic covariant derivatives
∂α: Ω0(X; g) 	→ Ω0,1(X; g)
satisfying the holomorphic Leibniz rule ∂α( fs) = (∂f )s + f ∂αs. G(X) acts on the
space of holomorphic covariant derivatives by conjugation, and therefore on the
space of g-valued (0, 1)-forms by
g · α = Ad(g)α − (∂g)g−1.
This formula extends to a holomorphic action of G(X)s+1 on A(X)s. The invariant
metric on k defines a weakly symplectic form (that is, a closed 2-form that defines
an injection TA(X)s → T∗A(X)s) on A(X)s for s &gt; 0 by
ωA(X): (a1, a2) 	→ X (a1 ∧ a2), where (a1 ∧ a2) is the real-valued L1 two-form on X defined by the wedge and inner products. In the case that the boundary of X is empty, the action of K(X)s+1
is Hamiltonian with moment map given by the curvature [3]
M(X)s → Ω2(X; k)s−1, A 	→ FA.
Let A (X)s denote the subspace of flat connections, A (X)s := {A ∈ A(X)s, FA = 0}.
The symplectic quotient M(X)s = K(X)s+1\\A(X)s := K(X)s+1\A (X)s is the moduli space of flat bundles on X. For s &gt; 2, we have a holonomy map Hol: A (2)(X)s → Hom(π1(X, x0),K).
Evaluation at the base point x0 defines a homomorphism K(X)s+1 → K such that
k · A = k(x0) · Hol (A).
It follows that the stabilizer subgroup K(X)s,A is isomorphic to KHol (A) and so
K(X)s,A is compact. The holonomy map induces a homeomorphism M(X)s → Hom (π1(X, x0),K)/K.
In the case X has nonempty boundary, the moment map picks up an additional
term A(X)s → Ω2(X; k)s−1 ⊕ Ω1(∂X; k)(3) s−1/2, A → (FA,−r∂XA)where r∂X is restriction to the boundary. That is, for all ξ ∈ k(X)s+1(ξA(X))ωA(X) = −d X (FA ∧ ξ) + d ∂X (r∂XA ∧ ξ).
Let K∂(X)s+1 be the subgroup fixing a framing on the boundary, K∂(X)s+1 = {k ∈ K(X)s+1, k|∂X = 1}.
For s &gt; 0 there is an exact sequence of Banach Lie groups 1 → K∂(X)s+1 → K(X)s+1 → K(∂X)s+12 → 1.
Surjectivity of the third map follows from triviality of π1(K) and the properties of the extension operator A.0.2 (e). The moment map for K∂(X)s+1 is the curvature and the symplectic quotient
M(X)s = K∂(X)s+1\\A(X)s := K∂(X)s+1\A (X)s is the moduli space of framed flat bundles on X. Note that the stabilizer K∂(X)s, A is trivial, since we can choose the base point to lie on the boundary. For s &gt; 2 this gives another proof that the operator dA | Ω0(X, ∂X; k)s+1 is injective.
Charts for M(X)s, s &gt; 0 are constructed from local slices for the gauge action
as follows. Using Lemma 3.0.1 and the implicit function theorem one sees that
for a ∈ Ω1(X; k)s sufficiently small there exists a unique gauge transformation
k ∈ K∂(X)s+1 in a neighborhood of the identity such that k · (A+ a) is in Coulomb
gauge with respect to A: d∗A(k · (A + a) − A) = 0.
Suppose that A is flat. By the implicit function theorem again, there exists a constant 	 depending only on  d−1 A , open neighborhoods of A, resp. 0.
