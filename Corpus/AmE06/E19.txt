Exploring Exterior Design 
Garden Design hosted a panel of experts to address issues in exterior design at the 2006 International Casual Furnishings and Accessories Market 
As a media sponsor of the 2006 International Casual Furnishings and Accessories Market at Chicago's Merchandise Mart, Garden Design magazine hosted a panel of experts to address issues in exterior design. Moderated by style editor Donna Dorian, the panel included Craig Bergmann, an expert plantsman with 25 years design experience; Janice Feldman, founder and CEO of Janus et Cie in Los Angeles, an upscale outdoor furnishings dealer with seven American showrooms; Jason Champion, owner and creative director of Design Kollection, a dealer in innovative outdoor furniture lines based in Florida; and Guillermo Castellanos of Evanston, Ill., a landscape architect and designer of the 2006 Cottage Living Idea Home garden. They discussed the distinctions between the roles of interior, exterior and landscape designers, and the use of new materials and products in the garden.
Exterior design experts say designers and retailers competing in the outdoor living rush face a new and challenging frontier: a market populated with Google-savvy consumers. Technology has brought about advances in outdoor décor  durable fabrics that shrug off the elements and furniture made of sustainable materials, for example  but the Information Age has also born the Internet and computer search engines. Potential exterior design customers are scouring the world for garden and patio products and inspiration without ever leaving their own back yards.
"You can get anything if you know how to Google," Craig Bergmann, a top Chicago area garden designer, said during a panel discussion on outdoor living trends. "Think of all the options available just in umbrella bases, for example."
 
Nowadays, when it comes to designing exterior spaces, "the sky's the limit, not a set of glass sliding doors," said Champion.
 
Feldman noted there is a niche burgeoning between the field of interior designers and that of landscape architects, who "typically don't have the same education about how we live in spaces," she said. "And while there is a crossover, I see a tremendous business opportunity for people who choose to focus on exterior design."
 
Castellanos said that outdoor living spaces should be considered "extensions of the house" and he noted that landscape architectsthe professionals called in for grounds planning and not usually furniture and fabric choicesshould not be thrown out of the outdoor room design mix because they bring with them historical and even urban-planning perspectives.
 
Bergmann agreed. He advocated a team approach to exterior design. "If I don't know something, I'd certainly bring in someone who does," he said.

Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG), in partnership with the Brooklyn Borough President and Independence Community Foundation, announced the winners of the 12th Annual Greenest Block in Brooklyn Contest. More than 255 blocks entered this year's 12th Annual Greenest Block in Brooklyn Contest, making it the most successful ever. The program serves to promote conservation and community through gardening activities.
First Place in the Residential Category is E. 25th Street Block between Clarendon and Avenue D. This year's winning block is no stranger to victory, having placed first in the 2004 Greenest Block in Brooklyn Contest.
For a full list of winners and for more information about the contest, visit bbg.org/greenbridge. 
According to Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, "The Greenest Block in Brooklyn is a contest in which everyone is a winner and Brooklyn is the biggest winner of all! It is a great reason every year to come together with neighbors to cultivate those yards and community gardens, hang those window boxes, and proudly display that every Brooklyn community is fertile ground for natural beauty. In more ways than one, New York City's "greenest borough", Brooklyn is growing!"  And Marilyn Gelber, executive director of the Independence Community Foundation, the founding sponsor of the competition said, "For over a decade, the Greenest Block in Brooklyn contest has built stronger communities by uniting neighbors under a common goal: to create a greener, healthier, and more beautiful Brooklyn. Independence is proud to continue helping the communities of Brooklyn to achieve this goal."
"This was my first year to serve as a judge in the contest and as the new kid on the block, so to speak, I was just amazed at the sheer beauty and sophisticated design characteristics  that reflect the diversity of our Brooklyn neighborhoods. I salute the hard work, talent, and sense of community that are such vital elements of this contest," said Scot Medbury, President of Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
Brooklyn GreenBridge, the community horticulture program of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, is designed to share the knowledge and resources of BBG with neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn. Working with block associations, community gardens, community centers, and other groups, Brooklyn GreenBridge promotes conservation and community through gardening activities.  "Everyone on our block was thrilled to have won the title of Greenest Block in Brooklyn, yet again" announced Hazel Foster, Greening Coordinator for the winning residential block. "Our block won the first place honor in 2004, and it changed our lives  for the better!  So it was no surprise that we agreed to dedicate ourselves to continue to practice what we learned and enter the contest as soon as we could. With help from Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Brooklyn GreenBridge program, we learned about good, smart gardening and in the process also found that participating in the Greenest Block is about more than winning a contest; it is also about a lifetime dedicated to building stronger, greener communities for future generations."
A ceremony recognizing the winners and entrants, hosted by BBG, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and the Independence Community Foundation took place on September 21, 2006. The Greenest Block in Brooklyn Contest is a project of Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Brooklyn GreenBridge Program and Borough President Marty Markowitz, and is sponsored by Independence Community Foundation. First Prize includes a $300 check and two coveted plants from Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Signature Plant collection for each top residential and commercial block winner.

The 2005 Way Hot 100: American Natives 
Interest in selected forms of native plants has never been greater. They're the obvious choice for creating gardens that look beautifully in place. 
 
	Amsonia tabernaemontana 'Blue Ice' (Blue star) Longer blooming than the species, the cool blue flowers continue for four to six weeks from mid- to late spring. Only 14 inches tall, it can even be used as a ground cover. Zones 4 to 9.
	Aster oblongifolius 'October Skies' (Dwarf aromatic aster) One of the last things to bloom in the glowing autumn garden, a compact plant with vibrant blue flowers and fragrant foliage. This is a "true plant for the designer...with an extravagant look and lots of flowers." (DHS) Zones 5 to 8.
	Athyrium filix-femina 'Dre's Dagger' (Lady fern) Thin, sharply pointed fronds have a crisscross pattern of leaflets. The crested tips continue to grow through the season, creating lush, frilly tassels. To 18 inches tall. Zones 4 to 9.
	Cercis canadensis 'Appalachian Red' (Redbud) This redbud cultivar "shouts when it opens" from dark reddish-purple buds to "glow-in-the-dark neon" magenta flowers, clustered thickly along the bare gray branches. (TB) Flowers later than most forms. Zones 4 to 9.
	Clematis viorna (Leather flower) This delicate-looking clematis is easy to grow in part shade. Urn-shaped flowers with thick, leathery petals, pinkish purple at the base and white at the tips, appear in late spring and bloom for several weeks, followed by golden, downy, Medusa-like seed heads. Zones 4 to 9.
	Coreopsis 'Crème Brulée' (Tickseed) Similar to 'Moonbeam', this selection is more vigorous with longer-lasting blossoms. The soft gold flowers occur all along the stem, not just at the tips, appearing earlier and continuing longer (into fall) than its popular cousin. Zones 4 to 9.
	Echinacea Big Sky TM Series (Coneflower) Hybrids between E. purpurea and E. paradoxa, the first introductions by Saul Nurseries are 'Sunrise' (yellow) and 'Sunset' (orange). They offer huge flowers in luscious colors, light fragrances ('Sunrise' has a "honey-rose scent"), a sturdy plant form and a longer bloom period. (RS) Zones 4 to 9.
	Heuchera 'Peach Flambé' One of the latest in a line of eye-popping heucheras, the bright peach-colored foliage with infusions of red really "blows people away." When backlit, "I just cannot explain the glow." (DH) Zones 4 to 9.
	Hibiscus 'Plum Crazy' (Rose mallow) Another in an outstanding series from the Fleming Brothers of Nebraska, this close relative of 'Kopper King' hibiscus has the same wine-colored foliage but darker flowers ("where rose meets purple") that reach 10 inches across and a purple eye zone. (DHS) Compact and shrubby, 3 to 5 feet tall. Zones 5 to 9.
	Hydrangea White Dome TM (Smooth hydrangea) "Like a smooth hydrangea on steroids" (PM), strong stems support the 6- to 10-inch, dome-shaped, creamy white blooms without flopping under the weight, as 'Annabelle' hydrangea often does. Large leaves have a thick, substantial texture and white undersides. Zones 4 to 7.
	Liriodendron tulipifera  Majestic Beauty TM (Tulip poplar) Unusual square-ended leaves are marked with yellow or greenish-yellow margins. A fast-growing shade tree with a signature straight trunk, to 80 feet. Flowers are tulip-shaped, chartreuse brushed with day-glo orange. Fall color is golden-yellow. Zones 4 to 9.
	Lonicera sempervirens 'John Clayton' (Coral honeysuckle) Unlike other yellow forms of the native honeysuckle, this heavy bloomer, selected by the Virginia Native Plant Society, continues to flower for a long time?from June through November. Good orange-red berries in the fall, very mildew resistant. Zones 4 to 8.
	Lysichiton americanus (Swamp lantern) A Northwest native with the intriguing names of swamp lantern and Western skunk cabbage. Large, yellow scoop-shaped flowers emerge in very early spring. Enormous 3-foot leaves follow. A dramatic plant for a boggy location. Zones 5 to 8.
	Opuntia ellisiana 'Burbank Spineless' (Prickly pear) Imagine the durability and drama of a cactus minus those pesky spines! With its "highly sculptural effect," it "makes a great focal point in a xeriscape planting, surrounded with other drought-tolerant but more delicate-looking plants." (PB) Zones 7 to 10.
	Penstemon 'Sour Grapes' Large, tubular, juicy purple flowers cluster thickly at the ends of pink-tinged stems that will mingle with nearby plants. Bright green narrow leaves are evergreen. Zones 6 to 9.
	Phlox paniculata 'Laura' (Summer phlox) Large heads of bright purple flowers with white, star-shaped eyes make 'Laura' a standout in the summer border. Mildew-resistant, dark green leaves line the sturdy 3-foot stems. Zones 4 to 8.
