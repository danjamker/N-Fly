A New Goal Standard
Capitals wing Alexander Ovechkin conjured up a score that left even the Great One awestruck and lifted the league with his gung-ho spirit

Goal: Alexander Ovechkin. Assists: Penn and Teller. � This is a halting attempt to describe the nearly indescribable six seconds of astonishing, mind-stretching hockey that will always live in online video and highlight reels: the Impossible Goal. Midway through the third period last Jan. 16 in Phoenix, Ovechkin, the blessed Capitals left wing, gathered the puck at the red line and burst down the right flank. Four strides over the blue line, retreating Coyotes defenseman Paul Mara checked him, but Ovechkin made an inside move that took him partway around Mara and pitched Ovechkin at a 45-degree angle toward the left corner of the rink. Stumbling because of Mara's persistent checking, Ovechkin, now perhaps 10 feet from goaltender Brian Boucher's net, at the lower edge of the left face-off circle, corkscrewed himself onto his back, took his left hand off his stick, cradled the puck with the hook of his blade and then, over his shoulder, like a twirler manipulating her baton on homecoming day, shoved the puck into the short side of the net past a stunned Boucher. So in summary, Ovechkin's 32nd goal, one of 52 he scored during his rookie season, was a prone, one-handed, upside-down, over-the-shoulder shot. And if all that fails to capture the Impossible Goal, try this: abracadabra.
"I don't know what was more amazing," says Phoenix coach Wayne Gretzky, who, like Ovechkin, could not resist glancing up at the Glendale Arena video board for another look that afternoon. "That goal or him blowing a kiss to me that day.... That goal was one of the prettiest I've ever seen. Guy Lafleur might have scored a few in the 1970s that were pretty remarkable, and maybe I scored a few nice ones, but not like that."
This was the year that the NHL, fresh off the lockout, fell through a rabbit hole and mystically came out the other side: Alex in Wonderland. Ovechkin and Penguins rookie Sidney Crosby, the would-be Magic and Bird of the missing-teeth set, took their marginalized sport and varnished it with a thick layer of conspicuous cool. In another era their simultaneous arrival might have laid the foundation for a two-decade Rocket Richard versus Gordie Howe or Gretzky versus Mario Lemieux--type rivalry, but Ovechkin and Crosby are as much allies as foes, cornerstones of a revitalized league that is trying to escape its niche. The egalitarian, salary-capped world that has replaced the era of star-laden circus teams might have damaged the NHL on a metaphysical level--as The Grand Inquisitor notes in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers: When everyone is somebody, then no one's anybody--but Ovechkin and Crosby proved ideal counterweights in 2006, incandescent players for a game that had slogged through a decade of drudgery.
"Know what I like about them?" says Gretzky. "These guys only talk about how great it is to play in the NHL. You never hear them saying, 'Ah, this is no good,' or, 'Ah, I don't like that.' This league did go through a little time where some guys were like, 'Why am I here? [The NHL is] lucky to have me.' That's kind of been weeded out, especially with these kids. They strike me as two kids who feel lucky to be here. That's their attitude, and if these guys are the mainstays, everybody else will follow their lead. I love watching them because they play hard every game."
The NHL, like a proud parent bursting to brag about its precocious children, will be happy to tell you how much better its league is now. Got a minute? Or, better yet, got six seconds and Internet access? When the clip of the Impossible Goal winds down and you've witnessed the first minor miracle of your lifetime, the only thing you can do is genuflect and click again and again--world without end boards, amen.


The Class of '06
SI's picks for the year-end awards range from a record-setting back to a rookie wideout who caught fire in New Orleans 
IT'S HARD to remember a year with so many deserving candidates for the NFL's major year-end awards. Only two categories - Coach of the Year and Most Valuable Player - have clear favorites; the rest of the picks are sure to provoke heated debate. SI polled a select group of players, coaches, executives and scouts to determine the consensus picks in the major categories, which are presented here, along with a less-obvious candidate worthy of consideration and SI's choice.
OFFENSIVE ROOKIE
Consensus 
Marques Colston, WR, Saints. Over the last few weeks Colston hasn't created as much buzz as Vince Young, Reggie Bush or Maurice Jones-Drew, but he's the only offensive rookie who's had a continuous impact since Week 1. The seventh-rounder out of Hofstra had four catches for 49 yards and a touchdown in his debut, a 19--14 win at Cleveland that suggested that these Saints might defy the experts' low preseason expectations for them. Colston has become a clutch target for quarterback Drew Brees in the NFL's top-ranked offense while topping all rookie wideouts with 66 receptions, 1,001 yards and seven touchdowns despite missing two games with a high ankle sprain. "He was one of the top receivers in the league, if not the best, before he got hurt," says one AFC scout. "He has made that offense better, and that's not something you see too often from a rookie, especially an unheard-of one." The seventh-rounder had a slight edge over first-round teammate Bush in SI's poll.
Consider 
Marcus McNeill, LT, Chargers. This second-rounder moved into the lineup after preseason foot surgery sidelined Roman Oben and has played like a veteran, plowing a path for LaDainian Tomlinson and guarding quarterback Philip Rivers's blind side. "I vote for guys who I've played against and who have done well," says Bengals defensive end Bryan Robinson. "He's done a great job playing left tackle as a rookie. That's tough."
SI's pick 
Colston 
DEFENSIVE ROOKIE
Consensus 
DeMeco Ryans, MLB, Texans. Houston thought so highly of this second-rounder that the team cut starting middle linebacker Sam Cowart in training camp and moved Ryans from the weak side to the middle. The result: The 6'2", 236-pound Ryans leads the NFL in solo tackles (112). "This kid makes plays all over the field, and that's not bad for someone viewed as too short to play in the NFL," says one AFC personnel man. "He doesn't have any apparent weaknesses, and he plays hard on every down. He's just as good against the run as he is against the pass."
Consider 
Devin Hester, CB/KR/PR, Bears. He plays some corner on the league's No. 1 defense, but because his major contributions have come on special teams (six returns for TDs), he misses out on this award.

SI's pick 
Ryans 
COMEBACK PLAYER
Consensus 
Drew Brees, QB, Saints. No surprise here, given what Brees has done for the Saints. Despite surgery last January to repair a torn labrum and partially torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder (which prompted the Chargers to let him go through free agency), the six-year veteran is having his best NFL season, with 4,240 yards, 25 touchdowns and only 11 interceptions. "Nobody gave him a chance," says Chargers linebacker Donnie Edwards. "They said he wouldn't be able to throw the ball over 30 yards. They said he wouldn't play again. For him to come back like that is awesome."
Consider 
Kellen Winslow, TE, Browns. After playing just two games in his first two seasons because of injury, the former first-round pick showed what he can do when healthy, with 76 receptions for 755 yards and three touchdowns.
SI's pick 
Chad Pennington, QB, Jets. Pennington is doubly deserving, since this is the second straight year he's come off rotator cuff surgery. At the end of the '05 season he faced serious questions about his future but responded by winning a heated quarterback competition in training camp and then leading the surprising Jets into playoff contention. With 2,958 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, the seventh-year vet doesn't have Brees's stats, but he also doesn't have the offensive weapons New Orleans has, and he inspired the Jets with his resilience.
DEFENSIVE PLAYER
Consensus 
Jason Taylor, DE, Dolphins. No defender had more of an impact week to week than the Dolphins' 10-year veteran. He's always been a dominant pass rusher (92 � sacks entering 2006), but this season he ramped up his all-around play (nine forced fumbles, two interceptions - both returned for touchdowns - and 12� sacks). "Few players have the presence of mind to turn good plays into great plays, but Jason does that on a routine basis," says Dolphins defensive end Kevin Carter. "Week in and week out, not only is he getting the sack, but he's causing the fumble, getting the interception or scoring a touchdown. He's turning good plays into great plays all the time."
Consider 
Shawne Merriman, OLB, Chargers. A four-game suspension for violating the league's policy on banned substances hurt his chances here, but his on-field production didn't drop after his return on Dec. 3. He's tied with Taylor and Green Bay's Aaron Kampman for second in the league with 12� sacks, spearheading a defense that leads the league in that category, with 54. "Merriman can change the game for his team," says one NFC executive. "You can argue that some of his sacks are scheme sacks - or that he gets a lot of them by going against backs - but he still has to get them."
SI's pick 
Taylor
OFFENSIVE PLAYER/MVP

Consensus 
LaDainian Tomlinson, RB, Chargers. It's impossible to argue against a player who set the NFL record for touchdowns (31) and points (186) with two games remaining. If those achievements aren't enough to sell Tomlinson, consider that he's the heart of the Chargers, and his presence has made the life of quarterback Rivers, a first-year starter, much easier. "He's such a threat, and he's so consistent," says Steelers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt. "He shows up for every game. He's a threat to take it to the house in the run game, and he's also a good blocker and a great receiver. There are so many things he can do."
Consider 
Brees was the pick of a handful of insiders in the SI poll.
SI's pick 
Tomlinson 
COACH
Consensus 
Sean Payton, Saints. New Orleans' first-year coach changed the mind-set on a team that mostly floundered for six seasons under Jim Haslett. The former Cowboys assistant consistently inspired and prepared his players while breaking in a new quarterback and overhauling the defense. At 9--5 the Saints aren't just a feel-good story - under Payton, they're a threat to reach the Super Bowl. Says Giants All-Pro running back Tiki Barber, " Payton has been masterful at utilizing the strengths of his players and bringing a contender to a city that desperately needed a hero." The only other coaches named in SI's poll were Marty Schottenheimer of the Chargers and Eric Mangini of the Jets; each got one vote.
Consider 
Jeff Fisher, Titans. Despite a dearth of veteran playmakers, the Titans have won seven of nine games since an 0--5 start and are, remarkably, in playoff contention. Fisher's deft touch has helped quarterback Young blossom.
SI's pick 
Payton 

Too Good To Be True
Keeping track of all the miscreants in sports--from liquored-up trees to larcenous wideouts--is a dirty job, and nobody has to do it. But Steve Rushin did it anyway
